    <h1>Rigid Body Collisions with a Surface</h1>
    <p>In instances where a moving rigid body impacts a solid and immovable surface, the resulting impact can seem chaotic. However, we can still use the ideas of impulse and momentum to predict this impact behavior.</p>
    <p>Just as it was with particles, an important first step in solving rigid body impact with a surface problems is to identify the normal and tangential directions. The normal direction will be perpendicular to the surface being impacted while the tangential direction will be parallel to the surface being impacted. Also important for rigid body impact is to identify both the center of mass for the body and the point of impact between the body and the surface.</p>
    <figure class="center"><img src="images/droppedwrench.png" width="390" height="293" alt="A wrench dropped on a rigid floor"/>
      <figcaption>Dropping a wrench on a concrete floor is a good example of rigid body impact with a solid surface. The first step in solving these problems is to identify the normal and tangential directions, which will be perpendicular and parallel to the surface respectively. Also important is identifying the center of mass (C) and point of impact (A).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>To predict the linear velocities after impact in the n and t directions, as well as the angular velocity after the impact (a total of three unknowns) we will need three equations. These equations will come in the form of the conservation of linear momentum in the t direction, as well as two equations based on the coefficient of restitution for the velocity in the n direction and the angular velocity after the impact.</p>
    <p>For momentum, we will notice that the normal forces during impact will always be in the normal direction. Assuming negligible friction forces (which would be in the tangential direction) we will have no change in linear momentum in the tangential direction and therefore <strong>no change in velocity in the tangential direction for the center of mass of the body</strong>. </p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[ \vec{J}_{1,x} = \vec{J}_{2,x}\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>or</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\[ \vec{J}_{1,t} = \vec{J}_{2,t} \]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Recall that linear momentum involves the linear velocity at the center of gravity only - we cannot chose to determine linear momentum at another point. This gives us the first equation we can use.</p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[v_{tCf}= v_{tCi}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Next examining the coefficient of restitution will give us another equation. Specifically, the coefficient of restitution relates the <strong>velocities before and after the collision in the normal direction (along the line of impact) at the point of impact</strong>.</p>
    <p>The coefficient of restitution is a relationship between the closing velocity and the separation velocity. The closing velocity is how rapidly are the impact points approaching each other before the impact. The separation velocity is how rapidly are the impact points moving away from each other after the impact.</p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[e=\frac{\Delta v_{separation} }{\Delta v_{closing}}\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\[e=\frac{v_{Anf} - v_{Fnf}}{v_{Fni} - v_{Ani}}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>For impacts against an immovable surface, the velocities of the floor, v<sub>Fn</sub>, will be zero. The equation then simplifies to:</p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[e=-\frac{v_{Anf}}{v_{Ani}}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>If the collision is elastic we would also conserve the kinetic energy of the body, giving us our third equation. Generally, energy is <em>not</em> conserved across an impact. Our final relationship comes from <strong>angular momentum</strong>. </p>
    <p>Because the force of the impact (and therefore the impulse of the impact) is so large, most other impulses (except reaction forces generated by the impact force) will be negligible in comparison. The impact impulse will primarily determine how the object moves after impact. Therefore <strong>about the location of impact, where the impact force has a zero moment arm, we can say that angular momentum is conserved</strong>. This is the only point about which angular momentum is conserved in an impact. (Note that, in problems where there is no impact, we can't generally say that impulses are negligible). </p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\vec{K}_{A,1} = \vec{K}_{A,2} \]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Since the point of impact is typically not the center of gravity or a pin, we often need to use the general expression of angular momentum. </p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\vec{K}_A = I_G \vec{\omega} + \vec{r}_{G/A} \times m \vec{v_G} \]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>OR</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\vec{K}_A = I_A \vec{\omega} + \vec{r}_{G/A} \times m \vec{v_A}  \]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Between the equations above and whatever relevant kinematics relationships are necessary we should be able to solve for up to three unknowns, allowing us to completely predict the velocities after impact, assuming we know the pre-impact velocities and the coefficient of restitution for the impact itself.</p>
