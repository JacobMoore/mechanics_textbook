    <h1>Impulse and Momentum in a Rigid Body</h1>
    <p>The concepts of <strong>Impulse</strong> and <strong>Momentum</strong> provide a third method of solving kinetics problems in dynamics. Generally this method is called the <strong>Impulse-Momentum Method</strong>, and it can be boiled down to the idea that the impulse exerted on a body over a given time will be equal to the change in that body's momentum. </p>
	  <p>The impulse-momentum equation is simply Newton's Second Law integrated with respect to time. </p>
	  <table class="equation">

          <td>\[ \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F} \,dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} m\vec{a}_G \,dt = m\vec{v}_G(t_2) - m\vec{v}_G(t_1) \]</td>

	  <p>The expressions on the left above will become linear or angular impulse, and the expressions on the right above will become the difference in linear or angular momentum between two points in time, or states. These equations assume that mass and mass moment of inertia stay the same over time. Recall that there are several expressions we can use for our moment equation, depending on the point about which we take the moments. There are equivalent impulse-momentum equations for each of those cases. </p>
	  <p>In a rigid body we will be concerned with not only linear impulse and momentum, but also <strong>angular</strong> impulse and momentum. The expressions describing a <strong>change</strong> in linear and angular impulse momentum are below. Recall that there are several versions of angular momentum expressions, including about points that are not the center of gravity. For linear momentum, only linear velocity at the center of gravity can be used. </p>

    <p>For two dimensional problems, we can break the linear impulse equation down into two scalar components to solve. In this case, we simply need to break all forces and velocities into x and y components. Since all rotation will be about the z-axis for planar problems, the angular impulse momentum equation remains a single equation.</p>

    <h2>Impulse:</h2>
    <p>As discussed with particles, a linear impulse in its most basic form is a force integrated over a time. For a force with a constant magnitude, we can find the magnitude of the impulse by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the time that force is exerted. If the force is not constant, we simply integrate the force function over the set time period. The direction of the impulse vector will be the direction of the force vector and the units will be a force times a time (Newton Seconds or Pound Seconds for example).</p>
    <table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Constant Magnitude Force:</td>
          <td>\[\Delta \vec{J} = \vec{F}*t\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Constant Magnitude Force:</td>
          <td>\[\Delta \vec{J} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F(t)} dt\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>An <strong>angular impulse</strong> is similar to a linear impulse, except it is the <strong>moment exerted over time</strong> instead of a force exerted over time.</p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Constant Magnitude Moment:</td>
          <td>\[\Delta \vec{K_G} = \vec{M_G}*t\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Constant Magnitude Moment:</td>
          <td>\[\Delta \vec{K}_G = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{M_G(t)} dt\]</td>
        </tr>

	  <p>Again, there are versions of these equations that use resultant moments about a point other than the center of gravity. These will include angular momentum about a point other than the center of gravity. When choosing which angular impulse-momentum equation to use, consider what values in the problem that you know or don't know. For example, if you don't know several reaction forces at a particular point, taking moments about that point (where those reaction forces have zero moment arm, and will not be included in the sum of moments) may simplify your equations. </p>
	<p>This moment can come either in the form of a torque directly applied to a body, or as an off-center force causing a linear and angular impulse at the same time. All moments should be taken about the center of mass of the body.</p>

        <p>A salmon hatchery has a gate to release water whenever water levels get too high. The gate is normally locked into place, but when the water reaches. The top of the gate, the lock is instantly removed. While the water would flow out of the gate by itself, there is a pump located upstream from the gate to push water forward. The pump is old, so its power slowly ramps up with time. The gate consists of a slender rod in which a 20 kg thin plate is attached. The plate has dimensions a=1.5 m,b=2 m and rotates about the slender rod as if it were a pin. Although there is a seal such that water may not get out, assume the contact between the plate and other surfaces is frictionless. If the gate is subject to water from the pump that applies a force distribution with a magnitude that is related to both the y-coordinate and time dF=(-t(y-2)^2+8t)  dy N, determine the angular velocity of the gate after t=2 seconds if the gate initially starts at rest. </p>
