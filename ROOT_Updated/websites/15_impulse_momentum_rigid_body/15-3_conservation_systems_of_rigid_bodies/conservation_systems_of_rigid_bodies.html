    <h1>Conservation of Momentum in Rigid Bodies and Systems of Rigid Bodies</h1>
    <p>When there are no linear impulses acting on a rigid body, we can say that linear momentum is conserved for that body. When there are no angular impulses acting on a rigid body about a particular point, we can say that angular momentum is conserved for the body about that point. That is, the momentum is the same between states, or between initial and final times. Impulses are external forces or moments that act over time.</p>

	  <p>Recall that there are additional expressions of angular momentum about other points.</p>
    <p>For an object, one direction of type of momentum may be conserved while others are not.</p>
    
    <h2>Conservation of momentum for a system of rigid bodies</h2>
    <p>While conservation of momentum for a single rigid body can be useful, it is more powerful when considering systems of rigid bodies. By considering two or more objects as part of the system, any forces or moments acting between those objects (i.e. contact forces, impact forces, etc.) are now <em>internal</em> to the system. Since we only consider <em>external</em> forces and moments when determining impulse, these forces no longer contribute to the impulse side of our impulse-momentum equation. This can allow us to use the simpler conservation of momentum equations, rather than performing integrals on complex time-varying forces, such as impact forces. </p>

	  <p>Note that the specific linear or angular momentum of one body in the system does not necessarily stay the same between states (i.e. momentum is not necessarily conserved for any one body in the system).</p>
	  <p>Conservation of angular momentum also works for momentum about points other than G, such as a pin, an ICZV, or any point P. Often, one can select a point about which the forces external to a system have zero-length moment arms, leading to conservation of angular momentum for the system about that point (even when angular momentum of the system is not conserved about other points, and/or linear momentum of the system is not conserved).</p>

      <div class="question">
        <h3>Question 1:</h3>
        <p>A helicopter tail rotor is used to prevent unwanted rotation of the body of the helicopter when the main rotor changes speed. Assume that the four main rotor blades are each long thin rods with length of 5 m and mass of 30 kg. Assume that the helicopter body has a mass of 750 kg and a mass moment of inertia of 1300 kg-m<sup>2</sup> at its centre of gravity, located vertically in line with the main rotor. The distance between the main and tail rotors is 6 m. 
        </p>
		  <p>If the tail rotor is NOT functioning (body starts from rest), find the final angular velocity of the helicopter body when the main rotor changes speed from 200 rpm to 300 rpm. (Hint: consider the horizontal x-y plane).</p>

        <h3>Question 3:</h3>
        <p>Montana James is now too old for the movie industry and has instead been replaced by his daughter, Mississippi Jane. In her new movie, Mississippi Jane makes a daring escape by jumping off a ledge. In an incredible feat of athletics, she grabs a hook and swings in a perfect circular arc to safety. If Jane has a mass m = 60 kg and a radius of gyration k<sub>G</sub> = 0.25 m, determine hr angular velocity after she has swung 90 degrees. Jane had an original velocity of v<sub>1</sub> = 3 m/s at a vertical height of h = 1.5 m away from the hook, and her center of gravity was a horizontal distance r<sub>G</sub> = 0.9 m. Assume her weight during impact does not act as an impulsive force. Assume that her arms stay in the same position as she swings, such that her center of gravity and radius of gyration do not change.  </p>

        <h3>Question 4:</h3>
        <p>Your new rotating magnetic decoration has arrived, and you turn it on to see how it looks. The decoration accelerates to an angular velocity of 5 rad/s, has a radius of gyration about long axis of k = 12 cm and a mass m = 400 g. You decide it looks good and turn it off, letting it spin freely at the same angular velocity. After leaving for a short while, you come back to find your box of paperclips knocked over and empty. All the paperclips are now stuck to the magnetic decoration. If each paperclip has a mass of mpaperclip = 2 g and increases the decoration’s average radius of gyration by 0.3 mm, how many paperclips are there if the angular velocity decreases to 2.1 rad/s? 
Assume the decoration continues to spin freely and the paperclips are uniformly distributed around the decoration.
