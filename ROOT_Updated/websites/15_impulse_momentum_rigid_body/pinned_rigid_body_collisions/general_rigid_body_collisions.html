    <h1>Free Rigid Body Collisions</h1>
	<p>A free rigid body collision is an instance where two non-anchored bodies impact one another, and we are treating at least one of those bodies as a rigid body where rotation can occur. In these instances, the <strong>large internal impulsive forces</strong> between the bodies colliding dwarf any external forces in the moment. The result is that though each body individually will have large changes in linear momentum in the instant of the collision, the linear momentum of both bodies as a whole is maintained.</p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
		<tr>
          <td>\[ m_{A} \vec{v_{Af}}+m_{B} \vec{v_{Bf}}= m_{A} \vec{v_{Ai}}+m_{B} \vec{v_{Bi}}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
	</table>
	<p>In addition to the linear momentum, angular momentum will also be conserved for each body individually <strong>about the point of impact</strong>. This is because the impact forces by definition cannot exert a moment about this point. With no moment, there can be no change in angular momentum. Moments are force times distance and we are ensuring the distance is zero by choosing the impact point where the forces are exerted.</p>
	<p>The angular momentum of each </p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
		<tr>
          <td>\[ m_{A} \vec{v_{Af}}+m_{B} \vec{v_{Bf}}= m_{A} \vec{v_{Ai}}+m_{B} \vec{v_{Bi}}\]</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td>\[ I_{A} \vec{\omega_{Af}}+I_{B} \vec{\omega_{Bf}}= I_{A} \vec{\omega_{Ai}}+I_{B} \vec{\omega_{Bi}}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
	</table>	
	<p>For two dimensional problems, we can break the linear impulse equation down into two scalar components to solve. In this case, we simply need to break all forces and velocities into x and y components, taking these velocities at the center of mass of each body. Since all rotation will be about the z-axis for planar problems, the angular impulse momentum equation remains a single equation. </p>

        <tr>
          <td>\[J_{x}=mv_{fx}-mv_{ix}\]</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td>\[J_{y}=mv_{fy}-mv_{iy}\]</td>
        </tr>

	<h2>Impulse:</h2>
	<p>As discussed with particles, a linear impulse in it's most basic form is a force integrated over a time. For a force with a constant magnitude, we can find the magnitude of the impulse by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the time that force is exerted. If the force is not constant, we simply integrate the force function over the set time period. The direction of the impulse vector will be the direction of the force vector and the units will be a force times a time (Newton Seconds or Pound Seconds for example).</p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
			<td>Constant Magnitude Force:</td>
          <td>\[\vec{J} = \vec{F}*t\]</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Non-Constant Magnitude Force:</td>
          <td>\[\vec{J} = \int \vec{F(t)} dt\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
	</table>
	<p>An <strong>angular impulse</strong> is similar to a linear similar, except it is the <strong>moment exerted over time</strong> instead of a force exerted over time. This moment can come either in the form of a torque directly applied to a body, or as an off-center force causing a linear and angular impulse at the same time. All moments should be taken about the center of mass of the body.</p>

      <figcaption>If we have two identical spheres with forces as shown above, the force on the left would cause only a linear impulse over time, while the force on the right would cause a linear impulse and an angular impulse over time.</figcaption>
    </figure>
	<h2>Momentum:</h2>  
	<p>As discussed with particles, the linear momentum of a body will be equal to the mass of the body times it's current velocity. Since velocity is a vector, the momentum will also be a vector, having both magnitude and a direction. Unlike the impulse, which happens over some set time, the momentum is captured as a snapshot of a specific instant in time (usually right before and after some impulse is exerted). The units for linear momentum will be mass times unit distance per unit time. This is usually kilogram meters per second in metric, or slug feet per second in English units.</p>
	<p>Angular momentum on the other had will be equal to the mass moment of inertia of that body (about it's center of mass) times it's current angular velocity. It's important to note that while the mass moment of inertia remains constant if the body does not change shape, a shape that does change shape will likely have changes in mass moments of inertia along with changes in angular velocity.</p>

      <figcaption>Figure skaters will often draw their arms an legs in during a spin to reduce their mass moment of inertia. With minimal impulses to change the angular momentum, the angular velocity will increase so that angular momentum is conserved. Public Domain image by deerstop.</figcaption>
