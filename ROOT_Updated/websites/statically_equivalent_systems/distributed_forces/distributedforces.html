		<h1>Distributed Forces</h1>
						
		<p>A distributed force is any force where the <strong>point of application</strong> 
		of the force is an <strong>area</strong> or a <strong>volume</strong>. This means that the 
		"point of application" is not really a point at all. Though distributed 
		forces are more difficult to analyze than point forces, distributed 
		forces are quite common in real world systems so it is important to 
		understand how to model them.</p>
		
		<p>Distributed forces can be broken down into <strong>surface forces</strong> and
		<strong>body forces</strong>. Surface forces are distributed forces where the 
		point of application is an area (a surface on the body). Body forces are 
		forces where the point of application is a volume (the force is exerted 
		on all molecules throughout the body). Below are some examples of 
		surface and body forces.</p>

		<h2>Representing Distributed Forces:</h2>
		
		<p>Distributed forces are represented as a field of vectors. This is 
		drawn as a number of discrete vectors along a line, over a surface, or 
		over a volume, that are connected with a line or a surface as shown 
		below.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Force Distributed over a Line" height="108" src="images/distributed2D.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>This is a representation of a surface force in a 2D 
			problem (A force distributed over a line). The magnitude is given in 
			units of force per unit distance.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Force Distributed over a surface" height="182" src="images/distributed3D.png" width="347">
			<figcaption>This is a representation of a surface force in a 3D 
			problem (a force distributed over an area). The magnitude is given 
			in units of force per unit area (also called a pressure).</figcaption>
		</figure>

		
		<p>Though these representations show a discrete number of individual vectors, 
		there is actually a magnitude and direction at all points along the 
		line, surface, or body. The individual vectors represent a sampling of 
		these magnitudes and directions.</p>
		
		<p>It is also important to realize that the magnitudes of distributed 
		forces are given in force per unit distance, area, or volume. We must 
		integrate the distributed force over it's entire range to convert the 
		force into the usual units of force.</p>
		
		<h2>Analysis of Distributed Forces:</h2>
		
		<p>Because distributed forces can vary in magnitude and direction with 
		position, they cannot be simply added or subtracted like point forces. 
		Instead much of the analysis relies on <strong>calculus</strong>, which 
		is needed to find the overall magnitude and direction the force exerts 
		over a given area and the overall moment the distributed force exerts 
		about a given point. This calculus based approach is needed to analyze 
		internal loads, but if we are only interested in external forces (such 
		as in statics and dynamics), then the simplest option is to convert these distributed loads 
		to their <strong>equivalent point loads</strong>. The equivalent 
		point load is a point force that would cause the same reaction forces 
		and moments as the original distributed force. Once the distributed 
		force has been converted to it's equivalent point load, it can be used 
		in analysis just as a point force would.</p>
