		<h1>Solving Systems of Equations with Matrices</h1>
		
		<p>A <strong>system</strong> of equations, is any set of equations that 
		share some variables such as the set of three equations shown below. </p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="A system of linear equations" height="163" src="images/system.png" width="350">
			<figcaption>The set of equations above is an example of a system of 
			linear equations.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In courses such as statics and dynamics we will often end up with a 
		system of linear equations and be asked to solve for the unknowns in those 
		equations. When we have just a few equations in our system, this can 
		easily be done with algebraic methods such as substitution or 
		elimination though addition or subtraction. For larger systems of 
		equations however, the easiest way to solve for the unknowns is to 
		convert the system of equations into a single matrix equation, and then 
		use computer tools to solve the matrix equation.</p>
		
		<p>This method will only work with systems of <strong>linear equations</strong>. 
		This means that we can only multiply the variables in the equations by a 
		constant. We cannot do things such as raise the variables to a power, have the variables 
		as an exponent, take the log of the variables, or multiply variables 
		together. Any of these operations would make the system of equations 
		non-linear, and will prevent us from converting them to a matrix 
		equation.</p>
		
		<p>Additionally, to have a solvable matrix equation we will need have 
		the <strong>same number of equations as unknown variables</strong>. For 
		example, above we have a system of equations with three equations and 
		three unknown variables. If these numbers do not match we will not be 
		able to solve the matrix equation later on.</p>
		
		<h2>Converting a System of Equations to a Matrix Equation:</h2>
		
		<p>The first step in converting a system of equations into a matrix 
		equation is to rearrange the equations into a consistent format. 
		Generally we will put all the variables with their coefficients on one 
		side of the equation and the constants on the other side of the 
		equation. Additionally, it is best to list the variables in the same 
		order in each equation. This process of rearranging the equations will 
		make conversion later on easier.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="The matrix conversion process" height="225" src="images/matrixconversion.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>To convert a system of equations into single matrix 
			equation, we will first rearrange the equations for a consistent 
			order, then we will write out the coefficient (A), variable (X), and 
			constant (B) matrices.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Next we will begin the process of writing out the three matrices that 
		make up the matrix equation. These three matrices are the coefficient 
		matrix (often referred to as the A matrix), the variable matrix (often 
		referred to as the X matrix), and the constant matrix (often referred to 
		as the B matrix).</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>The <strong>coefficient matrix</strong> (or A matrix) is an N x N matrix (where N is 
		the number of equations / number of unknown variables) that contains all 
		the coefficients for the variables. Each row of the matrix represents a single equation 
		while each column represents a single variable (it is sometimes helpful 
		to write the variable at the top of each column). For instances where a 
		variable does not show up in an equation, we assume a coefficient of 0.</li>
		<li>The <strong>variable matrix</strong> (or X matrix) is a 1 x N matrix 
		that contains all the unknown variables. It is important that the order 
		of the variables in the coefficient matrix matches the order of the 
		variables in the variable matrix.</li>
		<li>Finally, on the other side of the equals sign we have the <strong>
		constant matrix</strong> (or B matrix). This is a N x 1 matrix 
		containing all the constants from the right sides of the equations. It 
		is important that the order of the constants matches the order of 
		equations in the coefficient matrix.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once we have the three matrices set up we are ready to solve for the 
		unknowns in the variable matrix.</p>
		
		<h2>Solving the Matrix Equation:</h2>
		
		<p>Starting with our A, X, and B matrices in the matrix equation below, 
		we are looking to solve for for values of the unknown variables that are 
		contained in our X matrix.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="The matrix equation" height="79" src="images/matrixequation.png" width="233">
		</figure>

		<p>For a scalar equation, we would simply do this by dividing both sides 
		by A, where the value for X would be B/A. With matrix equation we will 
		instead need to multiple both sides of the equation by the inverse of 
		the A matrix. This will cancel out the A matrix on the left side, 
		leaving only the X matrix that you are looking for. This means that 
		multiplying the inverse of the A matrix times the B matrix will give you 
		a 1 x N matrix containing the solution for all the variables. The value 
		each row of the solution will correspond to the variable listed in the 
		same row of the X matrix.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">	
			<img alt="Solving the matrix equation" height="166" src="images/solvingmatrixequation.png" width="357">
		</figure>

		
		<p>It is possible to find the inverse of the A matrix by hand and to 
		multiply this by hand with the B matrix, but using computer tools such 
		as MATLAB or the Matrix Equation Solver in the panel on the left will 
		make these calculations far easier.</p>
