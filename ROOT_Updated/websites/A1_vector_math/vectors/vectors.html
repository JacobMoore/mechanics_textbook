		<p><strong>Vectors</strong> are used in engineering analysis to 
		represent quantities that have both a <strong>magnitude</strong> and a
		<strong>direction</strong>. Many engineering quantities, such as forces, 
		displacements, velocities, and accelerations, will need to be 
		represented as vectors for analysis. Vector quantities contrast with
		<strong>scalar</strong> values (such as mass and speed) which have a 
		magnitude but no direction.</p>
		
		<h2>Vector Representation:</h2>
						
		<p>In terms of representing vectors, there are two forms we can use to 
		represent vectors. These two forms are:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Magnitude and Direction Form</strong>: Where the magnitude is 
		given as a single quantity and the direction is given as an angle.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Component Form</strong>: Where the magnitude in the 
		horizontal and vertical directions are given. By having the two 
		components of the magnitude we can determine both the magnitude and the 
		direction of the vector.</p>
				
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="A vector as a magnitude and direction and in component form" height="152" src="images/vectorrep.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The drawing above shows a force as vector. On the left 
			the vector is represented as a magnitude and a direction. On the 
			right the same force is represented in terms of its x and y 
			components.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Converting Between Forms in 2D</h2>
		
		<p>For our analysis, we will often find it advantageous to have the 
		vectors in one form or the other, and will therefore need to convert the 
		vector from a magnitude and direction to component form or vice versa. 
		To do this we will use right triangles and trigonometry.</p>
		
		<h3>Going from a magnitude and direction to component form</h3>
		
		<p>To go from a magnitude and direction to component form we will first 
		draw a right triangle with the hypotenuse being the original vector. The 
		horizontal arm of the triangle will then be the x component of the 
		vector while the vertical arm is the y component of the vector. If we 
		know the angle of the vector with respect to either horizontal or 
		vertical, we can use the sine and cosine relationship to find the x and 
		y components.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Vector Magnitude and Direction to Component Form" height="241" src="images/magtocomponent.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>Using sine 
			and cosine relationships, we can find the x and y components of a vector.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>It is important to remember that how we measure the angle will affect 
		the sine and cosine relationships. Multiplying the magnitude by the sine 
		will always give us the opposite leg and multiplying the magnitude by 
		the cosine will always give us the adjacent leg.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Be careful with sine and cosines" height="206" 
			src="images/magtocomponent2.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>Depending upon how we measure the angle, the sine/cosine 
			may be either the x or y component. Remember the sine will give you 
			the opposite leg while the cosine will give you the adjacent leg.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h3>Going from component form to a magnitude and direction</h3>
		
		<p>To find the magnitude and the direction of a vector using components, 
		we will use the same process in reverse. We will draw the components as 
		the legs of a right triangle, where the hypotenuse of the triangle shows 
		the magnitude and direction of the vector.</p>
		
		<p>To find the magnitude of the vector we will use the Pythagorean 
		Theorem, taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each 
		component. To find the angle, we can easily use the inverse tangent 
		function, relating the opposite and adjacent legs of our right triangle.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Converting a vector from components back into magnitude and direction form" src="images/componenttomag.png">
   			<figcaption>We will use the Pythagorean Theorem and the inverse 
			tangent function to convert the vector back into magnitude and 
			direction form. </figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>If we know the magnitude of the hypotenuse, we can also use the 
		inverse sine and cosine functions in place of the inverse tangent 
		function to find the angle. As with the previous conversion, it is 
		important to clearly identify the opposite leg, the adjacent leg, and 
		the hypotenuse in our diagrams and to think of these when applying the 
		inverse trig functions.</p>
		
		<h2>Converting Between Forms in 3D</h2>
		
		<p>In three dimensions, we will have either three components (x, y, and 
		z) for component form or a magnitude and two angles for the direction in 
		magnitude and direction form. To convert between forms we will need to 
		draw in two sets of right triangles. The hypotenuse of the first 
		triangle will be the original vector and one of the legs will be one of 
		the three components. The other leg will then be the hypotenuse of 
		the second triangle. The legs of this second triangle will then be the 
		remaining two components as shown in the diagram below. Use sine and 
		cosine relationships to find the magnitude of each component along the 
		way.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Converting a 3D vector from a magnitude and direction to component form" height="458" src="images/3D1.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>For 3D vectors we will need to draw two right triangles 
			to convert between forms.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To go from component form back to a magnitude and direction, we will 
		use the 3D form of the Pythagorean Theorem (the magnitude will be the 
		square root of the sum of the three components squared) and we can again 
		use the inverse trig functions to find the angles. We simply need to 
		work backwards through the two right triangles.</p>
		
		<h3>Alternative method for finding components of 3D vectors</h3>
		
		<p>Sometimes, as with the tension in a cable, the geometry of the cable 
		is given in component form rather than as angles. In cases such as this 
		an alternative method can be used to find the components of the tension 
		in the cable. Rather than using trigonometry, this method instead relies 
		on ratios. The ratios of the components of the cable to the overall 
		length of the cable will be the same as the ratio of the corresponding 
		tension components to the overall magnitude of the tension.</p>
		
		<p>To use this method we will first need to find the overall length of 
		the cable using the Pythagorean Theorem. To find the x component of the 
		tension force, we simply multiply the overall magnitude of the tension 
		force by the x component of the length over the overall length of the 
		cable. We can then repeat with the y and z components.</p>
