		<h1>Trusses</h1>
				
		<p>A <strong>truss</strong> is an engineering structure that is made 
		entirely of <strong>two force members</strong>. In addition, statically 
		determinate trusses (trusses that can be analyzed completely using the 
		equilibrium equations), must be <strong>independently rigid</strong>. 
		This means that if the truss was separated from its connection points, 
		no one part would be able to move independently with respect to the rest 
		of the truss.</p>

			<figcaption>Trusses are made entirely of two force members. This 
			means that each member will either be in tension or compression as 
			shown above.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Trusses can be broken down further into <strong>plane trusses</strong> 
		and <strong>space trusses</strong>. A plane truss is a truss where all 
		members lie in a single plane. This means that plane trusses can 
		essentially be treated as two dimensional systems. Space trusses on the 
		other hand have members that are not limited to a single plane. This 
		means that space trusses need to be analyzed as a three dimensional 
		system.</p>

		<h2>Analyzing Trusses</h2>
		
		<p>When we talk about analyzing a truss, we are usually looking to 
		identify not only the external forces acting on the truss structure, but 
		also the forces acting on each member internally in the truss. Because 
		each member of the truss is a two force member, we simply need to 
		identify the magnitude of the force on each member, and determine if 
		each member is in tension or compression.</p>
		
		<p>To determine these unknowns, we have two methods available: the
		<strong>method of joints</strong>, and the <strong>method of sections</strong>. 
		Both will give the same results, but each through a different process.</p>
		
		<p>The method of joints focuses on the joints, or the connection points 
		where the members come together. We assume we have a pin at each of 
		these points that we model as a particle, we draw out the free body 
		diagram for each pin, and then write out the equilibrium equations for 
		each pin. This will result in a large number of equilibrium equations 
		that we can use to solve for a large number of unknown forces.</p>
		
		<p>The method of sections involves pretending to spilt the truss into 
		two or more different sections and them analyzing each section as a 
		separate extended body in equilibrium. In this method we determine the 
		appropriate sections, draw out free body diagrams for each section, and 
		then write out the equilibrium equations for each section.</p>
		
		<p>The method of joints is usually the easiest and fastest method for 
		solving for all the unknown forces in a truss. The method of sections on 
		the other hand is better suited to targeting and solving for the forces 
		in just a few members without having to solve for all the unknowns. In 
		addition, these methods can be combined if needed to best suit the goals 
		of the problem solver.</p>
