		<h1>Two Force Members</h1>
				
		<p>A <strong>two force member</strong> is a body that has forces (and 
		only forces, no moments) acting on it in only two locations. In order to 
		have a two force member in static equilibrium, the net force at each 
		location must be equal, opposite, and collinear. This will result in all 
		two force members being in either tension or compression as shown in the 
		diagram below.</p>

			opposite, and collinear for the body to be in equilibrium.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Why the Forces Must Be Equal, Opposite, and Collinear:</h2>
		<p>Imagine a beam where forces are only exerted at each end of the beam 
		(a two force member). The body has some non-zero force acting at on one 
		end of the beam, which we can draw in as a force vector. If this body is 
		in equilibrium, then we know two things: 1) the sum of the forces must 
		be equal to zero, and 2) the sum of the moments must be equal to zero.</p>
		
		<p>In order to have the sum of the forces equal to zero, the force 
		vector on the other side of the beam must be equal in magnitude and 
		opposite in direction. This is the only way to ensure that the sum of the 
		forces is equal to zero with only two forces.</p>
		
		<p>In order to have the sum of the moments equal to zero, the forces 
		must be collinear. If the forces were not collinear, then the two 
		equal and opposite forces would form a couple. This couple would exert a 
		moment on the beam when there are no other moments to counteract the 
		couple. Because of the moment exerted by the two forces must be equal to 
		zero, the perpendicular distance between the forces (d) must be equal to 
		zero. The only way to achieve this is to have the forces be collinear.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">			
			<img alt="Forces in a Two Force Member must be collinear" height="325" src="images/couple.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>In order to have the sum of the moments be equal to 
			zero, the forces acting on two force members must always be 
			collinear, acting along the line connecting the two points where 
			forces are applied</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Why are Two Force Members Important:</h2>
		
		<p>By identifying two force members, we greatly reduce the number of 
		unknowns in our problem. In two force members we know that the forces 
		must act along the line between the two connection points on the body. 
		This means that the direction of the force vectors is known on either 
		side of the body. Additionally, we know the forces are equal and 
		opposite, so if we determine the magnitude and direction of the force 
		acting on one side of the body, we automatically know the magnitude and 
		direction of the force acting on the other side of the body.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Forces act through the connection points" height="368" src="images/connectionpoints.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>The forces in two force members will always act along 
			the line connecting the two points where forces are applied.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Two force members are also important in distinguishing between 
		trusses, and frames and machines. When we analyze trusses using either 
		the method of joints or the method of sections, we will assume 
		everything is a two force member. If this assumption is incorrect, this 
		will cause serous problems in the analysis. By making this assumption 
		though, we can use some shortcuts that will make truss analysis easier 
		and faster than the analysis of frames and machines.</p>
