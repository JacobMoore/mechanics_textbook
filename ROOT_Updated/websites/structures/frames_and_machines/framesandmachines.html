		<h1>Frames and Machines</h1>
		
		<p>A <strong>frame</strong> or a <strong>machine</strong> is an 
		engineering structure that that contains at least one member that is not 
		a two force member.</p>
		
		<table class="figtable">
		<tr>
		<td>	
			<figure>
				<img alt="Not a two force member" height="164" src="images/nottwoforce1.png" width="250">
				<figcaption>This beam is connected to other members (where 
				normal forces would exist) at more than two locations. This beam 
				is therefor not a two force member.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img alt="Not a two force member" src="images/nottwoforce2.png">				
				<figcaption>This beam has two connection points, but a force is 
				acting on a third point. Therefore the beam has forces acting on 
				it at more than two locations and it is not a two force member.</figcaption>

		<p>A frame is a rigid structure, while a machine is not 
		rigid. This means that no part can move relative to the other parts in a 
		frame, while parts can move relative to one another in a machine. Though 
		there is a difference in vocabulary in describing frames and machines, 
		they are grouped together here because we use the same process to 
		analyze both of these structures. </p>

		<h2>Analyzing Frames and Machines</h2>
		
		<p>When we talk about analyzing frames or machines, we are usually 
		looking to identify both the external forces acting on the structure and 
		the internal forces acting between members within the structure.</p>
		
		<p>The method we use to analyze frames and machines (no special name 
		here) centers around the process of breaking the structure down into 
		individual components and analyzing each component as a rigid body. 
		Where the components are connected, Newton's Third Law states that each 
		body will exert an equal and opposite force on the other body. Each 
		component will be analyzed as an independent rigid body leading to 
		equilibrium equations for each component, but because of Newton's Third 
		Law, some unknowns may show up acting on two bodies.</p>
