		<h1>Center of Mass via the First Moment Integral</h1>
				
		<p>The <strong>center of mass</strong> of an an object is the point at 
		which we can assume all mass is concentrated for mechanics calculations. 
		Mass in any extended body is actually distributed over some volume, and 
		if the body is subjected to gravity then each bit of mass experiences 
		some gravitational force. The center of mass is the point at which all 
		the gravitational forces create <strong>zero net moment</strong> on the 
		body.</p>
		
		<p>Knowing the center of mass is critical for any mechanics problem that 
		deals with extended bodies, as this is where we will assume gravity 
		forces act and it is a critical point in dynamics calculations.</p>
		
		<p>Just as we had with centroids, two methods exist for finding the 
		center of mass:</p>
				
		<ol>
			<li>Using calculus and the first moment integral.</li>
			<li>Using the method of composite parts and tables of centroids for 
			common volumes.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The tables used in the method of composite parts however are derived 
		from the first method, so both methods ultimately use the moment 
		integrals.</p>
				
		<h2>Finding the Center of Mass for Uniform Density Parts</h2>
		
		<p>We will start by examining the center of mass for a uniform density 
		3D volume. The center of mass differs from from the centroid in that we 
		will be examining mass rather than areas or volumes. Taking the centroid 
		equations for a volume and substituting in the mass terms we have the 
		following initial equations for the center of mass.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">

		</figure>	
		
		<p>The mass terms can then be re written as a density times a volume. 
		This gives us a density term on both the top and bottom as shown below. 
		For the case where we have a uniform density throughout the whole part, 
		we can move the term in the integral outside the integral. It will then 
		cancel out with the density term on the bottom, leaving us with the 
		equation for the centroid of a volume.</p>
		
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Center of Mass for a Uniform Density Part" height="356" src="images/centerofmassequation2.png" width="600">
		</figure>		

		<p>This means that for a uniform density part, as we would have with any 
		part made of a single material, <strong>the center of mass and the 
		centroid are the same point</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>For objects made from multiple discrete parts, where each piece of 
		the body has a uniform density, we can use this method to find the 
		center of mass for each section, but we will need to use the method of 
		composite parts to find the overall center of mass.</p>
		
		<h2>Finding the Center of Mass for Non-Uniform Density Parts</h2>
		
		<p>In some rare cases, we may have an object in which the density of the 
		material is continuously changes with position. In these rare cases, we 
		will need to revisit the equations from earlier. We will leave the 
		density term in the integral (since it is not a constant), and we will 
		leave the bottom term as the mass (again since there is no constant 
		density term).</p>
				
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Center of Mass of a Non-Uniform Density Part" height="96" src="images/centerofmassequation3.png" width="600">
		</figure>		
		
		<p>In these calculations, the density term will be an equation that 
		defines the density at any given x, y, and z position, the dV term will 
		be the cross sectional area equation just as we had for centroids, and m 
		is the total mass of the body.</p>

			varying density, we must have an equation to describe the density 
			based on position.</figcaption>

			<p>A water and ceramic slurry with a uniform density of 1100 
			kilograms per meter cubed enters a settling tank with a height of

			the density of the slurry at the top of the tank is measured to be
