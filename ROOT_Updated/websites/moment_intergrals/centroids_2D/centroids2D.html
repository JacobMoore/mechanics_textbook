		<h1>Centroids in 2D via the First Moment Integral</h1>
				
		<p>The <strong>centroid</strong> of an area can be thought of as the 
		geometric center of that area. It is the average position (x and y 
		coordinate) of all the points in in 
		the area. If an area was represented as a thin, uniform plate, 
		then the centroid would be the same as the center of mass for this thin 
		plate.</p>
		
		<p>Centroids of areas are useful for a number of situations in the 
		mechanics course sequence, including the analysis of distributed forces, 
		the analysis of bending in beams, the analysis of torsion in shafts, and as an intermediate step in 
		determining moments of inertia which are used to determining an object's 
		resisting to rotational accelerations or an objects resistance to 
		bending or torsion. Two methods exist for finding the centroids 
		of shapes:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Using calculus and the first moment integral.</li>
			<li>Using the method of composite parts and tables of centroids for 
			common shapes.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The tables used in the method of composite parts however are derived 
		from the first method, so both methods ultimately use the moment 
		integrals.</p>
		
		<h2>Finding the Centroid via the First Moment Integral</h2>
		
		<p>When we find the centroid of a two dimensional shape, we will be 
		looking for both an x and a y coordinate, represented as x bar and y bar 
		respectively. This will be the x and y 
		coordinate of the point that is the centroid of the shape. </p>
		
		<p>To find the average x coordinate of a shape (x bar) we will, break 
		the shape into a large number of small very areas, for each area we will 
		multiply the area of that shape by it's x coordinate, sum all those 
		values up, and finally divide by the total area. To sum an infinite 
		number of infinitely small areas, we use integration. Specifically, this 
		sum is the <strong>first, rectangular, area moment integral</strong>, 
		where the x coordinate is the distance value in our moment integral. We 
		can do something similar with the y coordinates to find our y bar value 
		and arrive at the equations below.</p>

		<p>Next let's discuss what the variable dA represents and how we 
		integrate it over the area. The variable dA is the rate of change in area as we 
		move along an axis. For the x position of the centroid we will be moving 
		along the x axis, and for the y position of the centroid we will be 
		moving along the y axis.</p>
		
		<p>First let's look at the x axis, as we move along the x axis on a 
		shape from it's left most point to its right most point, the rate of 
		change of the area at any instant in time be equal to the height of the shape 
		at that point times the rate at which we are moving along the axis (dx). Because the height of the shape will change with 
		position, we do not use any one value, but instead must come up with an 
		equation that describes the height at any given value of x. We will then 
		multiply this equation by the variable x, and integrate that equation 
		from the leftmost x position of the shape (x min) the right most x 
		position of the shape (x max).</p>
				
		<figure class="center">		
			<img alt="The x coordinate of the centroid" height="423" src="images/dAx.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The x coordinate of the centroid.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To find the y coordinate of the of the centroid, we have a similar 
		process, but since we are moving along the y axis, the value dA is the 
		equation describing the width of the shape at any given value of y. We 
		will also integrate this equation from the y position of the bottommost 
		point on the shape (y min) to the y position of the topmost point on the 
		shape (y max).</p>	
		
		<figure class="center">		
			<img alt="The y coordinate of the centroid" height="406" src="images/dAy.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The y coordinate of the centroid.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Using the first moment integral and the equations shown above we can 
		theoretically 
		find the centroid of any shape as long as we can write an equation to 
		describe the height and width at any x or y value respectively. For more 
		complex shapes however, determining these equations and then integrating 
		these equations may become very time consuming. For these complex 
		shapes, the method of composite parts or computer tools will most likely 
		be much faster.</p>
		
		<h2>Using Symmetry as a Shortcut</h2>
		
		<p>Shape symmetry can provide a shortcut in many centroid calculations. 
		Remember that the centroid coordinate is the average x and y coordinate 
		for all the points in the shape. If the shape has a line of symmetry, 
		that means each point on one side of the line must have an equivalent 
		point on the other side of the line. This means that the average value 
		(aka the centroid) 
		must lie along the line of symmetry. If the shape has more than one line 
		of symmetry, then the centroid must exist at the intersection of the two 
		lines of symmetry.</p>

			lie somewhere along that line. If a shape has more than one line of 
			symmetry, the centroid must exist at the intersection of these 
			lines.</figcaption>
