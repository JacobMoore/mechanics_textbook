		<p>A <strong>moment integral</strong> is a general concept that can be 
		applied in a number of ways. As the name implies the moment integral 
		uses calculus to <strong>sum the moments</strong> of a force distributed 
		over some area (where the force and the moment arm can change with 
		position) or to
		<strong>sum the moments that would be needed to cause a uniform angular 
		acceleration </strong>(where the mass and the distance from the 
		rotational axis change with position). Some of the applications of moment integrals include:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Finding the equivalent point load for a distributed force.</li>
			<li>Finding the centroid of a 2D or 3D shape.</li>
			<li>Finding the center of mass for a 2D or 3D shape.</li>
			<li>Finding the rectangular or polar "moment of inertia" for a shape 
			or volume in order to determine the objects relationship between 
			moments and angular accelerations.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>When looking at moment integrals, there are number of different types 
		of moment integrals. These types include:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>2D vs. 3D Moment Integrals</li>
			<li>Area/Volume vs. Mass Moment Integrals</li>
			<li>First vs. Second Moment Integrals</li>
			<li>Rectangular vs. Polar Moment Integrals</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Any combination of these different types is possible (for example a 
		First, Rectangular, 2D, Area Moment of Inertia or a Second, Polar, 3D, 
		Mass Moment of Inertia). However, only some combinations will have 
		practical applications and will be discussed in detail on future pages.</p>
		
		<h3>2D vs. 3D Moment Integrals</h3>
		
		<p>Technically we can take the moment integral in any number of 
		dimensions, but for practical purposes we will almost always be dealing with either 2D areas or 3D 
		volumes. The number of dimensions will affect the complexity of the 
		calculations (with 3D Moment integrals being more involved), and the 
		nature of the problem (whether it is a 2D or 3D system) will determine 
		the type of moment integral needed. Often this is not listed in the type 
		of moment integral, requiring you to assume the type based on the 
		context of the problem (meaning it may be written as a Second, 
		Polar, Mass Moment of Inertia rather than a Second, Polar, 3D, Mass 
		Moment of Inertia).</p>
		
		<h3>Area/Volume vs. Mass Moments Integrals</h3>
		
		<p>The next distinction in moments of inertia is between area/volume 
		moment integrals and mass moment integrals. Area or volume moment 
		integrals (used for 2D areas and 3D volumes respectively) are used to 
		find centroids and find equivalent point loads for distributed forces. 
		These are integrated over some area or volume, and assume each little 
		bit of area or volume is equally weighted. Mass moment integrals, used 
		for center of mass or angular acceleration calculations, are also 
		usually integrated over the entire area or volume but take into account 
		possible changes in density, recognizing that not all bits of the shape 
		should be equally weighted. In cases of a uniform density part, the mass 
		moment integral is simply the area/volume moment integral times the 
		density of the part. Since it is usually easier to calculate the 
		area/volume moment integrals, we will sometimes use the area/volume 
		moment integrals to find the mass moment integrals for parts made of a 
		single uniform material.</p>
		
		<h3>First vs. Second Moments Integrals</h3>
		
		<p>The first moment integral uses the <strong>distance</strong> from the center axis or 
		point to calculate the moment. First moment integrals are useful in calculating 
		the equivalent point load, the centroid, and the center of mass of an 
		object, because on each of these we need to sum up the moments, which is 
		equal to the force (F) times the moment arm (d).</p>
		
		<figure class="center">				
			<img alt="The First Moment Integral" height="353" src="images/firstmoment.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The first moment integral is useful in finding the 
			total moment exerted by a force distributed over an area.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Second moments of inertia use the <strong>distance squared</strong>, and 
		are useful in relating moments to angular accelerations.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Second Moment Intergral" height="301" src="images/secondmoment.png" width="600">			
			<figcaption>The second moment integral is useful in determining the 
			relationship between the moment and angular acceleration of a rigid 
			body.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The figure above shows how the moment and angular acceleration of a 
		mass on the end of a stick are related by the mass times the distance 
		squared. For a rigid bodies we imagine them as an infinite number of 
		point masses, each on the end of a massless stick leading back to the 
		axis of rotation. The sum of all of these mass times distance squared 
		terms relates the overall moment exerted on the body to the overall 
		angular acceleration of the body.</p>
		
		<h3>Rectangular vs. Polar Moments Integrals</h3>
				
		<p>Finally we will talk about <strong>rectangular moments integrals</strong> 
		versus <strong>polar moments integrals</strong>. This is a difference in 
		how we define the distance in our moment integral. Let's start with the 
		distinction in 2D. If our distance is measured from some axis (for 
		example the x-axis, or the y-axis) then it is a rectangular moment 
		integral. If on the other hand the distance is measured from some point 
		(such as the origin) then it is a polar moment integral.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="2D rectangular versus polar moment intergrals" src="images/2D_rectangularpolar.png">			
			<figcaption>In 2D, if we measure the distance from some axis 
			(similar to what x and y do here) then we have a rectangular 
			moment integral. If we measure the distance from some point 
			(such as r does) then we have a polar moment integral.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In three dimensional problems, the definitions change slightly. For 
		rectangular moment integrals the distance will be measured from some 
		plane (such as the xy plane, xz plane, or yz plane). This will 
		correspond to the x, y or z coordinates of a point. For a polar moment 
		integrals the distance will be measured from some axis (such as the the 
		x, y, or z axis). </p>

			<figcaption>In 3D, if we measure from some plane (like x and y 
			do) then we have a rectangular moment integral. If we measure 
			the distance from some axis (such as r does) then we have a 
			polar moment integral.</figcaption>
