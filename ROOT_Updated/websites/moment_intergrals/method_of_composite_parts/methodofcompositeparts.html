		<h1>The Method of Composite Parts</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>method of composite parts</strong> can be used to find the 
		<strong>centroid</strong> or the 
		<strong>center of mass</strong> of any body with clearly defined 
		dimensions and masses. This method is an alternative to using the first 
		moment integral as discussed on previous pages, and is often easier and 
		faster. The method works by breaking the shape or volume down into a 
		number of more basic shapes, identifying the centroids or centers of 
		masses of each part, and then combing the results to find the overall 
		centroid or center of mass.</p>
		
		<p>A key aspect of the method is the use of centroid tables. This is a 
		set of tables that lists the centroids (and also moments of inertia) for 
		a number of common areas or volumes. Links to some centroid tables can 
		be found in the sidebar to the right. When breaking the shape down into 
		parts, it is usually beneficial to break it down into shapes or 
		volumes that can be found in these tables. The centroid or center of 
		mass of any shape that is not listed in the table will need to 
		calculated via the first moment integral.</p>
		
		<h2>Finding the Centroid via the Method of Composite Parts</h2>
		
		<p>To use the method of composite parts, we must first break a complex 
		shape down into several simpler shapes. This may include 
		areas or volumes (which we will count as positive areas or volumes) or holes (which we will 
		count as negative areas or volumes). Each of these shapes should have a 
		centroid we can look up in the table if possible.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">

			<figcaption>For the shape shown at the top, we can break it down 
			into a rectangle (1), a right triangle (2), and a circular hole (3).</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Once we have identified the different parts, we will create a table 
		indicating the area or volume, and the x and y coordinates (or x, y, and 
		z coordinates in 3D) for each shape. It is important to remember that each 
		coordinate you list should be <strong>relative to the same base origin point</strong>. 
		The centroid positions listed in the table will be axes shown in the 
		table. You will need to adjust this to take into account where the shape 
		is positioned.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">		
			<img alt="centroid table" src="images/table.png">			
			<figcaption>For each of the shapes, we need to find the area and the 
			x and y coordinates of the centroid. Remember to find the centroid 
			coordinates relative to a single set of axes that is the same for 
			all shapes.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Once you have the area and centroid coordinates for each shape, you 
		can find the x and y coordinate of the centroid for the overall shape 
		with the following formulas. Remember that areas for any shape that is a 
		hole in the design will be a negative area in your formula.</p>

		<h2>Finding the Center of Mass via the Method of Composite Parts</h2>
		
		<p>To use the method of composite parts to find the center of mass, we 
		must first break a complex volume down into several simpler volumes. 
		This may include volumes (which we will count as positive areas) or 
		cavities (which we will count as negative volumes). Each of these shapes 
		should have a center of mass that we can look up in 
		our table (remember that the centroid and center of mass are the same 
		point for any part with a uniform density).</p>
				
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Center of Mass Composite Parts" height="293" src="images/centerofmassparts.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>The first step in finding the center of mass via 
			composite parts is to break the shape up into several simpler 
			shapes. The figure on the left can be thought of as a semi-circular 
			hemisphere (1) on top of a cylinder (2) with another smaller cylinder cut 
			out of it (3).</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Once we have identified the different parts, we will create a table 
		indicating the mass of each part, and the x, y, and z coordinate of the 
		center of mass for each part. It is important to remember that each 
		coordinate you list should be relative to the same base origin point.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Center of Mass Table" height="511" src="images/centerofmasstable.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>Next we find the mass and center of mass of each 
			component of the part. Remember that all coordinates should be given 
			relative to the same axes and that cavities count as negative 
			masses. It is also important to not account for cavities twice. For 
			example, the mass of part two should be the mass of the cylinder 
			assuming it was solid cylinder, not a hollow cylinder.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Finally, once you have the mass the and center of mass coordinates 
		for each shape, you can find the coordinates of the center of mass for 
		the overall volume with the following formulas. Remember that any 
		volumes that represent a cavity in the design should be represented as 
		negative mass (The mass the cavity would have if it was made of the same 
		material as whatever it was cut out of).</p>
				
		<figure class="equation">		
			<img alt="Center of Mass Equations" height="435" src="images/centerofmassequations.png" width="343">
		</figure>
		
		<p>All of the calculations above use mass, rather than volumes. If the 
		composite shape is made of a uniform material with a constant density 
		however, then volume can be used interchangeably with the mass in the 
		formulas. This is because the mass will be the density times the volume, 
		and if all the densities are the same then the densities on the top end 
		up canceling out with the densities on the bottom of our formulas.</p>
