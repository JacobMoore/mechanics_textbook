		<h1>Static Equilibrium</h1>
				
		<p>Objects in static equilibrium are objects that are not accelerating 
		(either linear acceleration or angular acceleration). These objects may 
		be stationary, such as a building or a bridge, or they may have a 
		constant velocity, such as a car or truck moving at a constant speed on 
		a strait patch of road.</p>

		<p>Newton's second law states that the force exerted on an objects is 
		equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration it experiences. 
		Therefore, if we know that the acceleration of an object is equal to 
		zero, then we can assume that the sum of all forces acting on the object 
		are is zero. Individual forces acting on the object, represented by 
		force vectors, may not have zero magnitude but the sum of all the force 
		vectors will always be equal to zero for objects in equilibrium. 
		Engineering statics is the study of objects in static equilibrium, and 
		the simple assumption of all forces adding up to zero is the basis for 
		the subject area of engineering statics.</p>

		<p>Equilibrium follows a similar pattern for angular accelerations. The 
		rotational equivalent of Newton's second states that the moment exerted 
		on an object is equal to the moment of inertia of that object times the 
		angular acceleration of the object. If we know the angular acceleration 
		of an object is equal to zero, then we know the sum of all moments 
		acting on the object is equal to zero.</p>
