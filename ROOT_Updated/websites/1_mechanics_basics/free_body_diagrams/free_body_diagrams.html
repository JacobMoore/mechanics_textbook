		<h1>Free Body Diagrams</h1>
		
		<p>A free body diagram is a tool used to solve engineering mechanics 
		problems. As the name suggests, the purpose of the diagram is to "free" 
		the body from all other objects and surfaces around it so that it can be 
		studied in isolation. We will also draw in any forces or moments acting 
		on the body, including those forces and moments exerted by the 
		surrounding bodies and surfaces that we removed.</p>
		<p>The 
		diagram below shows a ladder supporting a person&nbsp; and the free body diagram of that ladder. 
		As you can see, the ladder is separated from all other objects and all 
		forces acting on the ladder are drawn in with key dimensions and angles 
		shown.</p>

		<h2>Constructing the Free Body Diagram</h2>
		
		<p>The first step in solving most mechanics problems will be to 
		construct a free body diagram. This simplified diagram will allow us to 
		more easily write out the equilibrium equations for statics or strengths 
		of materials problems, or the equations of motion for dynamics problems.</p>
		
		<p>To construct the diagram we will use the following process.</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>First draw the body being analyzed, separated from all other 
		surrounding bodies and surfaces.</li>
		<li>Second, draw in all forces and moments acting <strong>directly</strong> on the body. 
		Do not include any forces acting on the other bodies in the system. Some 
		common types of forces 
		seen in mechanics problems are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Gravitational Forces:</strong> Unless otherwise noted, the 
				mass of an object will result in a gravitational weight force applied 
				to that body. This weight is usually given in 
				pounds in the English system, and is modeled as 9.81 (g) times 
				the mass of the body in kilograms for the metric system 
				(resulting in a weight in Newtons). This force will 
				always point down towards the center of the earth and act on the 
				center of mass of the body. </li>
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Gravitational Forces" height="173" src="images/gravityforces.png" width="450">
			<figcaption>Gravitational forces always act downward on the center 
			of mass.</figcaption>
		</figure>
				<li><strong>Normal Forces (or Reaction Forces): </strong>Every object in direct contact with 
				the body will exert a normal force on that body which prevents 
				the two objects from occupying the same space at the same time. 
				Note that only objects in direct contact can exert normal forces 
				on the body.
				<ul>
					<li>An object in contact with another object or surface will 
					experience a normal force that is perpendicular (hence 
					normal) to the surfaces in contact.</li>
					<figure class="center">
						<img alt="Normal Forces" height="248" src="images/normal1.png" width="450">
						<figcaption>Normal forces always act perpendicular to 
						the surfaces in contact. The barrel in the hand truck 
						shown on the left has a normal force at each contact 
						point.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<li>Joints or connections between bodies can also cause 
					reaction forces or moments, and we will have one force or 
					moment for each type of motion or rotation the connection 
					prevents. </li>
					<figure class="center">
						<img alt="Reaction forces at Joints" height="382" src="images/normal2.png" width="450">
						<figcaption>The roller on the left allows for rotation 
						and movement along the surface, but a normal force in 
						the y direction prevents motion vertically. The pin 
						joint in the center allows for rotation, but normal 
						forces in the x and y directions prevent motion in all 
						directions. The fixed connection on the right has a 
						normal forces preventing motion in all directions and a 
						reaction moment preventing rotation.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Friction Forces:</strong> Objects in direct contact with the 
				body can also exert friction forces on the body, which will resist 
				the two bodies sliding against one another. These forces will 
				always be perpendicular to the surfaces in contact. Friction is 
				the subject of an entire chapter in this book, but for simple 
				scenarios we usually assume rough or smooth surfaces.<ul>
					<li>For smooth surfaces we assume that there is no friction 
					force.</li>
					<li>For rough surfaces we assume that the bodies will not 
					slide relative to one another no matter what. In this case 
					the friction force is always just large enough to prevent 
					this sliding.</li>
				<figure class="center">
						<img alt="Friction Forces" height="326" src="images/friction.png" width="450">
						<figcaption>For a smooth surface we assume only a normal 
						force perpendicular to the surface. For a rough surface 
						we assume normal and friction forces are present.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Tension in Cables:</strong> Cables, wires or ropes attached to 
				the body will exert a tension force on the body in the direction 
				of the cable.</li>
				<figure class="center">
						<img alt="Tension in Cables" height="164" src="images/tension.png" width="450">
						<figcaption>The tension force in cables always acts 
						along the direction of the cable.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<li>The above forces are the most common, but other forces such 
				as pressure from fluids, spring forces and magnetic forces may 
				exist and may act on the body.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Once the forces are identified and added to the free body diagram, 
		the last step is to label any key dimensions and angles on the diagram.</li>
		</ol>
