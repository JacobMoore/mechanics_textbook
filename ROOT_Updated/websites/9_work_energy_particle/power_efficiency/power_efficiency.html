    <h1>Power and Efficiency in Particles</h1>
	<p>Related to the concepts of work and energy are the concepts of <strong>power</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>. At its core, power is the rate at which work is being done, and efficiency is the percentage of useful work or power that is transfered from input to output of some system.</p>
	<h2>Power:</h2>
	<p>Power at any instant is defined as the derivative of work with respect to time. If we look at the average power over a set period, we can simply measure the work done and divide that by the time. Work is defined as the force times the distance traveled, and distance over time is the velocity of a object, giving us many possible options for relating power, work, force, distance, time, and velocity.</p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[P=\frac{dW}{dt}\]</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td>\[P_{ave}=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{F*d}{t}=F*v\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
	<p>The common units of power are <strong>watts</strong> for metric, where one watt is defined as a joule per second, or a newton meter per second, and <strong>horsepower</strong> in the English system where one horsepower is defined as 550 foot pounds per second. Maximum power ratings are often a primary specification for motors and engines as gear trains can easily change the torque provided by a motor, but the overall power will not be altered by gearing.</p>
	<figure class="center"><img src="images/two_cars.png" width="600" height="207" alt="Two cars with differing power."/>
      <figcaption>Assuming the two cars above have the same mass, it would take the same amount of work to get them up to a set speed (such as 60 miles per hour). However, the more powerful car would be able to get to this speed in a much shorter time period.</figcaption>
    </figure>
	<h2>Efficiency:</h2>
	<p>Any devices with work/power inputs and outputs will have some loss of work or power between that input and output due to things like friction. While energy is always conserved, some energies such as heat may not be considered useful. A measure of the useful work or power that makes it from the input of a device to the output is the efficiency. Specifically efficiency is defined as the work out of a device divided by the work into the device. With power being the work over time, efficiency can also be described as power out divided by the power in to a device (the time term would cancel out leaving us with our original definition).</p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\eta=\frac{W_{out}}{W_{in}}=\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}\]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
	<p>It is impossible to have efficiencies greater than one (or 100%) because that would be a violation of the conservation of energy, however for most devices we wish to get the efficiencies as close to one as possible. This is not only because it does not waste work/power, but also because any work or power that is "lost" in the device will be turned into heat that may build up.</p>
