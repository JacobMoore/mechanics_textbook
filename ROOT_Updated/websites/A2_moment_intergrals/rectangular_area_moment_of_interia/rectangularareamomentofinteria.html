		<h1>The Rectangular Area Moment of Inertia</h1>
		
		<p>The Second Moment Integral, often just called the <strong>Moment of 
		Inertia</strong>, can be useful in engineering mechanics calculations 
		for a number of reasons. </p>
		
		<p>For example:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Second Rectangular Area Moment of Inertia</strong> 
			of a beam's cross section represents that beam's resistance to 
			bending.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Second Polar Area Moment of Inertia</strong> of a 
			shaft's cross section represents that shaft's resistance to torsion.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Second Mass Moment of Inertia</strong> represents a 
			body's resistance to angular accelerations.</li>
		</ul>
				
		<p>Each of these three types of moments of inertia can be calculated via
		<strong>integration</strong> or via <strong>composite parts</strong> and 
		the<strong> parallel axis theorem</strong>. On this page we are going to focus on calculating the second rectangular 
		area moment of inertia via integration.</p>
		
		<h2>Bending Stresses and the Second Area Moment</h2>
		
		<p>When an object is subjected to a bending moment, that body will 
		experience both internal tensile stresses and compressive stresses as 
		shown in the diagram below. These stresses exert a net moment to 
		counteract the loading moment, but exert no net force so that the body 
		remains in equilibrium.</p>

			internal compressive stresses.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		
		<p>As we can see in the diagram, there is some central plane along which 
		there are no tensile or compressive stresses. This is known as the 
		neutral surface, and if there are no other forces present it will run 
		through the centroid of the cross section. As we move up or down from 
		the neutral surface the stresses increase linearly. The moment exerted by 
		this stress at any point will be the stress times moment arm, which also 
		linearly increases as we move away from the neutral surface. This means 
		that the resistance to bending provided by any point in the cross 
		section is directly proportional to the distance from the neutral axis 
		squared. We can sum up the resistances to bending then using the second 
		rectangular area moment of inertia, where our distances are measured from the neutral 
		axis.</p>

		<h2>Calculating the Second Rectangular Area Moment of Inertia via Integration</h2>
		
		<p>The first step in determining the rectangular moment of inertia for an area is to 
		determine what axis we will define as the zero point. In 
		cases on bending stress this will be the neutral surface, which will 
		travel through the centroid of the beam's cross sectional area. It is 
		usually useful at this point to draw the neutral surface onto the shape 
		we are finding the moment of inertia for.</p>
		
		<p>To take the moment of inertia about the x axis we will need to use 
		the distances from the x axis (in this case the y coordinates of each 
		point) and integrate over the area. Moving from bottom to top, the rate 
		of change of the area at any given y value will be the width of the 
		shape at that point times the rate at which we are moving along the y 
		axis. Since the width often changes as we move along the y axis, we will need 
		to find an equation that describes width at any value of y (this will be 
		some function of the variable y). This gets 
		multiplied by y squared in the second moment integral.</p>

			<figcaption>The rectangular moment of inertia about the x axis.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To find the moment of inertia about the Y axis we will use the 
		distances from the Y axis (in this case the X coordinates of each 
		point). Moving from left to right, the rate of change of the area will 
		be the height of the shape at that point times the rate at which we are 
		moving left to right. Again we will need to describe this with an 
		equation if the height is constantly changing. We will multiply this by 
		x squared for the second moment integral and this will give us the 
		moment of inertia about the y axis.</p>
