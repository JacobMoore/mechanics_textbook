		<h1>Centroids in 3D via the First Moment Integral</h1>
				
		<p>The <strong>centroid</strong> of a volume can be thought of as the 
		geometric center of that area. It is the average position (x, y, and z 
		coordinates) of all the points in the area. If this volume represents 
		a part with a uniform density (like most single material parts) then the 
		centroid will be the same as the center of mass.</p>
		
		<p>Centroids are useful for a number of situations in the mechanics 
		course sequence, including the analysis of distributed forces, 
		determining the center of mass, and as an intermediate step in 
		determining moments of inertia which are used to determining an object's 
		resistance to rotational accelerations or  
		bending and torsion.</p>
		
		<p>Just as we had with centroids of areas, two methods exist for finding 
		centroids of volumes:</p>
				
		<ol>
			<li>Using calculus and the first moment integral.</li>
			<li>Using the method of composite parts and tables of centroids for 
			common volumes.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The tables used in the method of composite parts, however, are derived 
		from the first method, so both methods ultimately use the moment 
		integrals.</p>
				
		<h2>Finding the Centroid via the First Moment Integral</h2>
		
		<p>When we find the centroid of a three dimensional shape, we will 
		be looking for x, y, and z coordinates (x bar, y bar, and z bar). This 
		will be the x, y, and z coordinates of the point that is the centroid of 
		the shape.</p>
		
		<p>Much like the centroid calculations we did with 2D shapes, we are 
		looking to find the shape's average coordinate in each dimension. We do 
		this by summing up all the little bits of volume times the x, y, or z 
		coordinate of that bit of volume and then dividing that sum by the total 
		volume of the shape. Again we will use calculus to sum up an infinite 
		number of infinitely small volumes. Specifically this sum will be the 
		<strong>first, rectangular, volume moment integral</strong> for the shape. 
		Working in each of the three coordinate directions we wind up with the 
		following three equations.</p>
		
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Centroid Equation 3D" height="105" src="images/centroidequation.png" width="600">
		</figure>		

		<p>With these new equations we have the variable dV rather than dA, 
		because we are integrating over a volume rather than an area. This represents the 
		rate of change of the volume as we move along an axis from one end to 
		another. The rate of change of the volume at any point on the shape will 
		be the <strong>cross sectional area</strong> that is perpendicular to 
		that axis. Since cross sectional area varies as we move along the axis, 
		we will need to determine a formula for the cross sectional area at any 
		point along that axis.</p>

			<img alt="The center of mass" height="428" src="images/centerofmass.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The z coordinate of the center of mass.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Using the first moment integral and the equations shown above we can 
		theoretically find the centroid of any volume as long as we can write an 
		equation to describe the cross section area for each direction. For more 
		complex shapes, however, determining these equations and then integrating 
		these equations may become very time consuming. For these complex 
		shapes, the method of composite parts or computer tools will most likely 
		be much faster.</p>
		
		<h2>Using Symmetry as a Shortcut</h2>
		
		<p>Just as with 2D areas, shape symmetry can provide a shortcut in many 
		centroid calculations. Remember that the centroid coordinate is the 
		average x, y, and z coordinate for all the points in the shape. If the 
		volume has a plane of symmetry, 
		that means each point on one side of the line must have an equivalent 
		point on the other side of the line. This means that the average value 
		(aka. the centroid) 
		must lie within that plane. If the volume has more than one plane 
		of symmetry, then the centroid must exist at the intersection of these 
		planes.</p>
