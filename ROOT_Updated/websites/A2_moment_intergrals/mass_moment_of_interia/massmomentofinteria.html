		<h1>The Mass Moment of Inertia</h1>
		
		<p>The Second Moment Integral, often just called the <strong>Moment of 
		Inertia</strong>, can be useful in engineering mechanics calculations 
		for a number of reasons. </p>
		
		<p>For example:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Second Rectangular Area Moment of Inertia</strong> 
			of a beam's cross section represents that beam's resistance to 
			bending.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Second Polar Area Moment of Inertia</strong> of a 
			shaft's cross section represents that shaft's resistance to torsion.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Second Mass Moment of Inertia</strong> represents a 
			body's resistance to angular accelerations.</li>
		</ul>
				
		<p>Each of these three types of moments of inertia can be calculated via
		<strong>integration</strong> or via <strong>composite parts</strong> and 
		the<strong> parallel axis theorem</strong>. On this page we are going to 
		focus on calculating the mass moment of inertia via integration.</p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>The mass moment of inertia is a moment integral, specifically the 
		second, 3D, polar, mass moment integral. To see why this relates moments 
		and angular accelerations, we start by examining a point mass on the end 
		of a massless stick as shown below. Imagine we want to rotate the stick 
		about the left end by applying a moment there. We want to relate the 
		moment exerted to the angular acceleration of the stick about this 
		point.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">		
			<img alt="Moments and Angular Acceleration for a Mass on a stick" height="226" src="images/massonstick.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>Starting with the traditional form of Newton's Second 
			Law, we can substitute in values to find the relationship between 
			the moment and angular acceleration for a point mass on the end of a 
			massless stick.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To relate these two variables, we start with the traditional form of 
		Newton's Second Law, stating that the force exerted on the point mass by 
		the stick will be equal to the mass times the acceleration of the point 
		mass (F = m a). Next we substitute some values. The force due to the 
		moment will be the magnitude of the moment over the moment arm (d), and 
		the acceleration of a point around a fixed axis is the angular 
		acceleration times the distance between the point and the axis of 
		rotation (d). If we substitute these values for F and a, we end up 
		with an equation stating that the moment exerted at the end of the stick 
		will be equal to the mass times the distance squared times the angular 
		acceleration.</p>
		
		<p>If we were to have multiple masses all connected together with 
		massless sticks such that they form a single body as shown below, then 
		we would need to add up all the mass times distance squared terms to 
		relate the moment exerted on the body to the angular acceleration.</p>

			<figcaption>Approximating a rigid body as an infinite number of 
			infinitely small masses all connected to the axis of rotation, 
			we can sum all the m d squared terms with integration.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>For rigid bodies with mass distributed over some volume, we can think 
		of the body as a collection of very small point masses all connected 
		with a stick back to the central axis of rotation. Using integration to 
		sum up this infinite number of infinitely small masses, we end up with 
		the second polar mass moment integral.</p>
		
		<p>This moment integral for the shape, called the mass moment of 
		inertia, relates the moment and the angular acceleration for the body 
		about a set axis of rotation.</p>

		<h2>Calculating the Mass Moment of Inertia via Integration</h2>
		
		<p>The first step in calculating the mass moment of inertia is to 
		determine the axis of rotation. Unlike mass, the mass moment of inertia 
		is <strong>dependent on the axis of rotation</strong>. After choosing 
		the axis of rotation, it is helpful to draw the  the shape with the axis 
		of rotation included.</p>
		
		<p>Next we will be integrating over the mass of the object. The mass at 
		any one location will be the volume times the density, and if we have a 
		uniform density then we can bring the density outside of the integral 
		leaving us with a density times a volume integral.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Pulling the density out of the mass intergral" height="282" src="images/volumemomentint.png" width="282">
		</figure>

		<p>Remembering that d is measured from the axis of rotation, we need to 
		define dV in terms of a radius (r) moving outwards from the axis of 
		rotation. The rate of change of the volume (dV) will be the area at 
		exactly r distance away from that axis times the rate of change of r. 
		This will be a cylindrical area that changes with the value of r. We 
		therefore need to define this area as an equation relating the area to 
		the value of r. We multiply that by r squared for the second moment 
		integral and evaluate from the minimum radius out to the maximum radius 
		from the axis of rotation.</p>
