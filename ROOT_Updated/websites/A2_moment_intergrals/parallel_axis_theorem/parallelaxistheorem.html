		<h1>Composite Parts for Moments of Inertia and the Parallel Axis Theorem</h1>
				
		<p>As an alternative to integration, both area and mass moments of 
		inertia can be calculated by breaking down a complex shape into simple, 
		common parts, looking up the moments of inertia for these parts in a table, 
		adjusting the moments of inertia for position, and adding them together to find the overall moment of 
		inertia. This method is known as the <strong>method of composite parts</strong>.</p>
		<p>A key part to this process that was not present in centroid 
		calculations is the adjustment for position. Moments of inertia for the 
		parts of the body can only be added if they all have the same axis of 
		rotation. The moments of inertia in the table are generally listed 
		relative to that shape's centroid though. Because each part has its own 
		individual centroid coordinate, we cannot simply add these numbers. 
		We will use something called the <strong>Parallel Axis Theorem</strong> 
		to adjust the moments of inertia so that they are all taken about some 
		standard point. Once the moments of inertia are adjusted with the 
		Parallel Axis Theorem, then we can add them together using the method of 
		composite parts.</p>
								
		<h2>The Parallel Axis Theorem</h2>
		
		<p>When we calculated the area and mass moments of inertia via 
		integration, one of the first things we had to do was to select a point 
		or axis we were going to take the moment of inertia about. We then 
		measured all distances from that point or axis, where the distances were 
		the moment arms in our moment integrals. If we pick a different point or 
		axis to serve as the center, then all of these distances will be different, 
		which means that we will get a different moment of inertia.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img height="241" src="images/axisselection.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>The distances used in our moment integrals depends on 
			the point or axis chosen.</figcaption>
		</figure>	
		
		<p>For the instance on the right however, each of these distance vectors 
		can be broken down into a vector from the origin to the centroid, and 
		then a vector from the centroid to all the points in the shape. 
		Similarly, we can find the overall moment of inertia by adding two sets 
		of moment integrals. The first moment integral will add up all the 
		distance vectors from the origin to the centroid (This will be like a 
		point mass on a massless stick, so we get a mass times distance squared 
		term), the second will be the moment integral about the centroid (which 
		is what is listed in the tables). By adding these two terms together we 
		can find the moment of inertia about the given origin point.</p>

			<figcaption>The Parallel Axis Theorem states that a body's moment of 
			inertia about any given axis is the moment of inertia about the 
			centroid plus the mass of the body times the distance between the 
			point and the centroid squared.</figcaption>
		</figure>		

		<p>This works for both mass and area moments of inertia as well as for 
		both rectangular and polar moments of inertia. Above, the mass moment of 
		inertia is listed, but if we substitute in areas instead of masses we 
		can use it for area moments of inertia. </p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Parellel Axis Theorem" height="371" src="images/massorarea.png" width="323">
			<figcaption>For mass moments of inertia we will use the mass of the 
			body, and for area moments of inertia we will use the area of the 
			shape.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>For rectangular area moments of inertia and for 3D mass moments of 
		inertia the distances in the equation will be the distance between the 
		axis or rotation and the centroid while for 2D polar moments of inertia 
		we will measure the distances from the point of rotation to the 
		centroid.</p>

		</figure>

		
		<p>With these equations we can see that the moment of inertia of a body 
		is always lowest about its centroid (where d = 0), and that the further 
		we move away from the centroid the larger the moment of inertia will 
		become.</p>
		
		<h2>Using the Method of Composite Parts to Find the Moment of Inertia</h2>
		
		<p>To find the moment of inertia of a body using the method of composite 
		parts, we must go the following steps.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>First, we need to break the complex shape down into simple shapes. 
			These should be shapes that have moments of inertia listed in moment of 
			inertia tables.</li>
			<li>For each of the individual shapes we will want to identify the 
			area or mass (where holes or cavities count as negative areas or 
			masses), the coordinates of the centroid, and the shape's 
			moment of inertia about its centroid. It is often useful to list these values in a table in order to 
			more easily keep track of the values.</li>
			<li>Next we will want to identify the common point we will take the 
			overall moment of inertia about. Sometimes this will be given to us 
			and other times it will need to be calculated (it is often the 
			centroid of the overall shape, in which case you use the method of 
			composite parts to calculate that).</li>
			<li>Once you have identified the point you are taking the moment of 
			inertia about, you will need to measure the distances between this 
			point and the centroids of each shape (the way you measure these 
			distances will depend on the type of moment or inertia, see the 
			figure above for details). Add these distances to your table as the 
			d values.</li>
			<li>Next use the distances and the area or mass to calculate the 
			correction for your moments of inertia (m d squared or A d squared). 
			Add these corrections to the moments of inertia about the 
			centroids to get the corrected moments of inertia.</li>
			<li>Add the corrected moments of inertia to find the total moment of 
			inertia for the combined shape.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The diagram below shows a shape that has been broken down and the 
		table used to calculate the overall moment of inertia.</p>

			moments of inertia, distance corrections, and corrected moments of

			corrected moment of inertia columns.&nbsp; </figcaption>
