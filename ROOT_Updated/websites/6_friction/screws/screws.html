		<h1>Power Screws</h1>
				
		<p>A power screw (also sometimes called a lead screw) is another simple 
		machine that can be used to create very large forces. The screw can be 
		thought of as a wedge or a ramp that has been wound around a shaft. By 
		holding a nut stationary and rotating the shaft, we can have the nut 
		sliding either up or down the wedge in the shaft. In this way a 
		relatively small moment on the shaft can cause very large forces on the 
		nut.</p>

		<h2>Static Analysis of Power Screws:</h2>
		
		<p>The easiest way to analyze a power screw system is to turn the 
		problem into a 2D problem by "unwrapping" the ramp from around the 
		shaft. To do this we will need two numbers. First we will need the
		<strong>diameter</strong> of the shaft, and second we will need either 
		the <strong>threads-per-inch/centimeter</strong> or the <strong>pitch</strong> 
		of the screw. The threads-per-inch tells you how many threads you have 
		per inch/centimeter of screw. With a single thread design (most screws) 
		this will also be the number of times the thread wraps around the screw 
		in one inch/centimeter. The pitch on the other hand gives you the 
		distance between two adjacent threads. Either of these numbers can be 
		used to find the other.</p>
		
		<p>Once we have these numbers, we can imagine unwrapping the ramp from 
		around the screw and ending up with a ramp in one of the two situations 
		below. In either case, we can use the inverse tangent function to find 
		the <strong>lead angle</strong>, which can be thought of as the angle of 
		the thread that the nut is climbing up. Finding the lead angle is the 
		first step in analyzing a power screw system.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="The lead angle of a screw" height="259" src="images/leadangle.png" width="500">
			<figcaption>The lead angle of a screw is the angle of the thread 
			that the nut will be climbing up as the shaft rotates.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Once we find the lead angle, we can draw a free body diagram of the 
		"nut" in our unwrapped system. Here we include the pushing force which 
		is pushing our nut up the incline, the load force which is the force the 
		nut exerts on some external body, the normal force between the nut and 
		screw, and the friction force between the nut and the screw.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Screw Free Body Diagram" height="280" src="images/screwfbd.png" width="500">			
			<figcaption>The free body diagram of the "nut" in our power screw 
			system.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>If our screw is pushing a load at some constant rate, then we can 
		assume two things: First the nut is in equilibrium, so we can write out 
		the equilibrium equations for the nut. Second the nut is sliding, 
		indicating that the friction force will be equal to the normal force 
		times the kinetic coefficient of friction.</p>
        
        \[\vec{F}_f= \mu_k*\vec{F}_N\]
        
        \[\sum \vec{F}_x=\vec{F}_{push}-\vec{F}_N*sin\left ( \theta  \right )-\mu _k*\vec{F}_N*cos\left ( \theta  \right )=0\]
        
        \[\sum \vec{F}_y=\vec{F}_{push}-\vec{F}_N*cos\left ( \theta  \right )-\mu _k*\vec{F}_N*sin\left ( \theta  \right )=0\]

		<p>We can then simplify the equation above into a single equation 
		relating the load force and the pushing force.</p>
        
        \[\vec{F}_{push}=\frac{sin\left ( \theta  \right )+\mu_k*cos\left ( \theta  \right )}{cos\left ( \theta  \right )-\mu_k*sin\left ( \theta \right )}*\vec{F}_{load}\]

		<p>In reality the pushing force is not a single force at all. It is the 
		forces preventing the nut from rotating with the screw. The cumulative 
		pushing force will really cause an equal and opposite moment to the 
		input moment that is spinning the shaft.</p>
        
        <p>\[\vec{M}=\vec{F}*d\]</p>

		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="The pushing force and the input moment" height="360" src="images/moment.png" width="320">			
			<figcaption>The pushing force is really just a representation of the 
			forces keeping the nut from rotating. If the nut is not rotating 
			then they must cause an equal and opposite moment to the torque that 
			is driving the screw.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Finally, if we replace the pushing force with the moment that is 
		driving the screw in our system, we can relate the input torque that is 
		driving our screw, to the force that the nut on the screw is pressing 
		forward with. Screw systems are usually designed to nallow fairly small 
		input moments to push very large load forces.</p>
        
        \[\vec{T}=\frac{sin\left ( \theta \right )+\mu_k*cos\left ( \theta \right )}{cos\left ( \theta \right )-\mu_k*sin\left ( \theta \right )}*\vec{F}_{load}*r_{shaft}\]

		<h2>Self Locking Screws</h2>
		
		<p>Imagine we apply a torque to a power screw to lift a body, then when 
		we get the load to the desired height we stop applying that toque to 
		let the body sit where it is. If we were to redraw our free body diagram 
		form earlier for the new situation, we would find two things.
		<ol>
		<li>The pushing force is missing (since a torque is no longer applied to 
		the shaft).</li>
		<li>The friction is now fighting against the nut sliding back down the 
		ramp.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Self Locking Screw Free Body Diagram" height="324" src="images/selflockingfbd.png" width="418">	
			<figcaption>Without the pushing force from an applied torque, the 
			friction force acts to prevent the nut from sliding down the ramp.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>With this new free body diagram, there are two possible scenarios 
		that could occur:</p>
		
		<p>
		<ol>
		<li>The friction force is large enough to keep the nut from sliding down 
		the ramp, meaning everything will remain in static equilibrium if 
		released.</li>
		<li>The friction force will not be sufficient to keep the nut from 
		sliding down the ramp, meaning that the load would begin to fall as soon 
		as the torque is removed from the shaft.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>With power screw applications such as a car jack, the second option 
		could be very dangerous. It is therefore important to know if a power 
		screw system is self locking (option 1 from above) or not self locking 
		(option 2 from above).</p>
		
		<p>To define the boundary between self locking systems and non-self 
		locking systems, we use something called the <strong>self locking angle</strong>. 
		As intuition would tell us, slipping does not occur on very gentle 
		slopes (small lead angles) while it does occur on very steep slopes 
		(large lead angles). The angle at which the nut would begin to slip is 
		known as the self locking angle.</p>
		
		<p>To find the self locking angle, we will assume impending motion 
		(relating the friction force to the normal force) and leave the lead 
		angle as an unknown. This lets us create the free body diagram as shown 
		below and gives us the equilibrium equations below.</p>
    
        \[\sum \vec{F}_x=-\vec{F}_N*sin\left ( \theta \right )+\mu_s*\vec{F}_N*cos\left ( \theta \right )=0\]
    
        \[\sum \vec{F}_y=-\vec{F}_{load}+\vec{F}_N*cos\left ( \theta \right )+\mu_s*\vec{F}_N*sin\left ( \theta \right )=0\]
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Self Locking Angle in Power Screws" height="397" src="images/lockinganglefbd.png" width="500">	
			<figcaption>Assuming impending motion, we write out the equilibrium 
			equations for the nut with the unknown lead angle.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Using the x equilibrium equation as a starting point, we can solve 
		for theta (eliminating the normal force all together in the process). 
		This new equation shown below gives us the self locking angle. Systems 
		with lead angles smaller than this will be self locking, while systems 
		with lead angles larger than this will not be self locking.</p>
    
        \[\theta_{locking}=tan^{-1}\left ( \mu_s \right )\]
