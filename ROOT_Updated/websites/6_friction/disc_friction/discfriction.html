		<h1>Disc Friction</h1>
				
		<p>Disc friction is the friction that exists between the end of a 
		rotating shaft or other rotating body and a stationary surface. Disc 
		friction will tend to exert a moment on the bodies involved, resisting 
		the relative rotation of the bodies&nbsp; Disc friction is 
		applicable to a wide variety of designs including end bearings, collar 
		bearings, disc brakes, and clutches.</p>

			<figcaption>This orbital sander rotates a circular sanding disc

			disc and the surface will exert a moment on both the surface and the 
			sander.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Hollow Circular Contact Area</h2>
		
		<p>To start our analysis of disc friction we will use the example of a 
		collar bearing. In this type of bearing, we will have a rotating shaft 
		traveling through a hole in a surface. The shaft is supporting some load 
		force as shown and a collar is used to support the shaft itself. In this 
		case we will have a hollow circular contact area between the rotating 
		collar and the stationary surface.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Collar Bearing" height="294" src="images/collarbearing.png" width="400">
			<figcaption>In a collar bearing we will have a hollow circular 
			contact area between the rotating collar and the stationary surface.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The friction force at any point in the contact area will be equal to 
		the normal force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction 
		at that point. If we assume a uniform pressure between the collar and 
		the surface and a uniform coefficient of friction then we will have a 
		the same friction force exerted at all points. This does not translate 
		however into an equal moment exerted by each point. Points further from 
		the center of rotation will exert a larger moment than points closer to 
		the center of rotation because they will have a larger moment arm.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Friction in a Collar Bearning" height="238" src="images/collarfriction.png" width="400">
			<figcaption>Though the friction forces at any point will be the 
			same, points along the outside surface of the contact area will 
			exert a larger moment than points along the inside surface of the 
			contact area.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>To determine the net moment exerted by the friction forces, we will 
		need to use calculus to sum up the individual moments over the entire 
		contact area. The moment at each individual point will be equal to the 
		kinetic coefficient of friction, times the normal force pressure at that point 
		(p), times the distance from that point to the center of rotation (r).</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Moment due to disc friction" height="94" src="images/eq1.png" width="472">
		</figure>
		
		<p>To simplify things we can move the constant coefficient of friction, 
		and the constant normal force pressure term outside of the integral. We 
		can also replace the pressure term with the load force on the bearing 
		over the contact area. Finally, so that we can integrate 
		over the range of R values, we can recognize that the rate of change in 
		the area (dA) for the hollow circular areas is simply the rate of change of the r 
		(dr) term time the 
		circumference of the circle at r. These changes lead to the equation 
		below.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">		
			<img alt="" height="111" src="images/eq2.png" width="523">
		</figure>
		
		<p>Finally we can evaluate the integral from the inner radius to the 
		outer radius. If we evaluate the integral and simplify we will end up 
		with the final equation below.</p>

		<h2>Other Contact Area Shapes</h2>
		
		<h3>Solid Circular Contact Area</h3>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="An End Bearing" height="307" src="images/endbearing.png" width="400">
			<figcaption>An end bearing has a solid circular contact area between 
			the rotating shaft and the stationary bearing.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In cases where we have a solid circular contact area such as with a 
		solid circular shaft in an end bearing or with the orbital sander shown 
		at the top of the page we simply set the inner radius to zero and we can 
		simplify the formula. If we do so, the original formula is reduced to 
		the equation below.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">
			<img alt="Disc Friction" height="98" src="images/eq4.png" width="287">
		</figure>

		<h3>Circular Arcs (Disc Brakes)</h3>
		
		<p>In cases, such as in disc brakes, we may have a contact area that 
		looks like a section of the hollow circular contact area we had earlier. 
		For this scenario however, we have less area to exert the friction force 
		and cause a moment, but the smaller area also causes higher pressures in 
		that contact area for the same load force. The end result is that these terms cancel each other 
		out and we end up with the same formula we had for the hollow circular 
		contact area when examining a single brake pad. Most disc brakes however have a 
		pair of pads however (one on each side of the rotating disc), so we will 
		need to double the moment in our equation for the usual pair of pads.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Disc Brakes" height="348" src="images/discbrake.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The contact area in disc brakes is often approximated as 
			a circular arc with a given contact angle (theta)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The calculations above show that the contact angle (theta) is 
		irrelevant to the stopping power of the brakes in theory. In practice 
		however, larger brake pads can slightly increase the stopping power of 
		the brakes and have other advantages such as better heat distribution.</p>
