		<h1>Dry Friction</h1>
				
		<p><strong>Dry friction</strong> is the force that opposes one solid 
		surface sliding across another solid surface. Dry friction always 
		opposes the surfaces sliding relative to one another and can have the 
		effect of either opposing motion or causing motion in bodies.</p>

		<p>The most commonly used model for dry friction is <strong>coulomb 
		friction</strong>. This type of friction can further be broken down into
		static friction and kinetic friction. These two types of friction are 
		illustrated in the diagram below. First imagine a box sitting on a 
		surface. A pushing force is applied parallel to the surface and is 
		constantly being increased. A gravitational force, a normal force, and a 
		frictional force are also acting on the box.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Coulomb Friction" height="375" src="images/coulombfriction.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>As the pushing force increases, the static friction 
			force will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
			until the point of impending motion. Beyond this point, the box will 
			begin to slip as the pushing force is greater in magnitude than the 
			kinetic friction force opposing it.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p><strong>Static friction</strong> occurs prior to the box slipping and 
		moving. In this region the friction force will be equal in magnitude and 
		opposite in direction to the pushing force itself. As the magnitude of 
		the pushing force increases so does the magnitude of the friction force.</p>
		
		<p>If the magnitude of the pushing force continues to rise, eventually 
		the box will begin to slip. As the box begins to slip the type of 
		friction opposing the motion of the box changes from static friction to 
		what is called kinetic friction. The point just before the box slips is 
		known as <strong>impending motion</strong>. This can also be thought of 
		as the maximum static friction force before slipping. The magnitude of 
		the maximum static friction force is equal to the static coefficient of 
		friction times the normal force existing between the box and the 
		surface. This coefficient of friction is a property that depends on both 
		materials and can usually be looked up in tables.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Kinetic friction</strong> occurs beyond the point of impending motion when the box is sliding. 
		With kinetic friction, the magnitude of the friction force opposing 
		motion will be equal to the kinetic coefficient of friction times the 
		normal force between the box and the surface. The kinetic coefficient of 
		friction also depends upon the two materials in contact, but will almost 
		always be less than the static coefficient of friction.</p>
