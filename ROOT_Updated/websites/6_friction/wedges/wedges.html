		<h1>Wedges</h1>
				
		<p>A wedge is a thin wedge-shaped object that is used to force two 
		objects apart or to force one object away from a close surface. Wedges 
		have the effect of allowing users to create very large normal forces to 
		move objects with relatively small input forces. The friction forces 
		in wedge systems also tend to be very large though, and can reduce the 
		effectiveness of wedges.</p>

			<figcaption>A hammer is used to push this wedge into the crack in 
			this log. The normal forces are pushing the two halves of the log 
			apart while the friction forces are opposing the pushing force.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>To analyze a wedge system we will need to draw free body diagrams 
		of each of the bodies in the system (the wedge itself and any bodies the 
		wedge will be moving). We need to be sure that we include the pushing 
		force on the wedge, normal forces along any surfaces in contact, and 
		friction forces along any surfaces in contact.</p>

			<figcaption>The top diagram shows a wedge being used to push a safe 
			away from a wall. The first step in analyzing the system is to draw 
			free body diagrams of the wedge and the safe. Remember that all 
			normal forces will be perpendicular to the surfaces in contact and 
			that all friction forces will be parallel to the surfaces in 
			contact.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>After we draw the free body diagram we can work to simplify the 
		problem. It is usually assumed that the wedge and the bodies will be 
		sliding against one another, so each friction force will be equal to the kinetic coefficient 
		of friction between the two surfaces times the associated normal force 
		between the two forces. This reduces the number of unknowns and will 
		usually allow us to solve for any unknown problems.</p>

			<figcaption>By replacing each of the friction forces with the 
			kinetic coefficient of friction times the normal force, we can 
			reduce the number of unknowns in our analysis.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>With our simplified diagram we will assume that the bodies are all in 
		equilibrium and we will write our equilibrium equations for the two 
		bodies. By solving the equilibrium equations, we can solve for any 
		unknowns we have.</p>

			<h3>Question 1:</h3>
			<p>A heavy safe is being pushed away from a wall with a wedge as 
			shown below. Assume the wedge has an angle of 5 degrees, the 
			coefficient of friction (static and kinetic) between the wedge and 
			the safe is .16, and the coefficients of friction (static and 
			kinetic) between the wedge and the wall and the safe and the floor 
			are both .35. What is the pushing force required to move the safe 
			out from the wall?</p>
