		<h1>Moments</h1>
						
		<p>A <strong>moment</strong> (also sometimes called a torque) is defined as the "tendency of a force to rotate a body". 
		Where forces cause linear accelerations, moments cause <strong>angular 
		accelerations</strong>. In this way moments, can be thought of as twisting 
		forces.</p>

			<figcaption>Imagine two boxes on an icy surface. The force on box A 
			would simply cause the box to begin accelerating, but the force on 
			box B would cause the box to both accelerate and to begin to rotate. 
			The force on box B is exerting a moment, where the force on box A is 
			not.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>The Vector Representation of a Moment:</h2>
		
		<p>Moments, like forces, can be represented as vectors and have a 
		magnitude, a direction, and a "point of application". For moments 
		however a better name for the point of application is the <strong>axis 
		of rotation</strong>. This will be the point or axis about which we will 
		determine all the moments. </p>
				
		<h3>Magnitude:</h3>
		
		<p>The magnitude of a moment is the degree to which the moment will 
		cause angular acceleration in the body it is acting on. It is 
		represented by a scalar (a single number). The magnitude of the moment 
		can be thought of as the strength of the twisting force exerted on the 
		body. When a moment is represented as a vector, the magnitude of the 
		moment is usually explicitly labeled. though the length of the moment 
		vector also often corresponds to the relative magnitude of the moment.</p>
		<p>The magnitude of the moment is measured in units of force times 
		distance. The standard metric units for the magnitude of moments are 
		newton meters, and the standard English units for a moment are foot 
		pounds.</p>
		
		<figure class="equation">

		<h3>Direction:</h3>
		
		<p>In a two dimensional problem, the the direction of can be thought of 
		as a scalar quantity corresponding to the direction of rotation the 
		moment would cause. A moment that would cause a counter-clockwise 
		rotation is a positive moment and a moment that would cause a clockwise 
		rotation is a negative moment.</p>
		
		<figure class="right">	
			<img alt="The Right Hand Rule" height="249" src="images/rhr.png" width="300">
			<figcaption>To use the right hand rule, align your right hand as 
			shown so that your thumb lines up with the axis of rotation for the 
			moment and your curled fingers point in the direction of 
			rotation for your moment. If you do this, your thumb will be 
			pointing in the direction of the moment vector.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In a three dimensional problem however, a body can rotate about an 
		axis in any direction. If this is the case we need a vector to represent 
		the direction of the moment. The direction of the moment vector will 
		line up with the axis of rotation that moment would cause, but to 
		determine which of the two directions we can use along that axis we have 
		available we use the right hand rule. To use the right hand rule, align 
		your right hand as shown so that your thumb lines up with the axis of 
		rotation for the moment and your curled fingers point in the direction of 
		rotation for your moment. If you do this, your thumb will be 
		pointing in the direction of the moment vector.</p>
		
		<p>If we look back to two dimensional problems, all rotations occur 
		about an axis pointing directly into or out of the page (the z axis). 
		Using the right hand rule, counter-clockwise rotations are represented 
		by a vector in the positive z direction and clockwise rotations are 
		represented by a vector in the negative z direction.</p>
		
		<h3>Axis of Rotation:</h3>
		
		<p>In engineering statics problems we can choose any point/axis as the 
		axis of rotation. The choice of this point will affect the magnitude and 
		direction of the resulting moment however, and the moment is only valid 
		about that point.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="The magnitude and direction of a moment depends upon the chosen axis of rotation" height="192" src="images/momentpoint.png" width="450">
			<figcaption>The magnitude and direction of a moment depends upon the 
			chosen axis of rotation. For example, the single force above would 
			cause diffrent moments about Point A and Point B, because it would 
			cause different rotations depending on the point we fix in place.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Though we can take the moment about any point in a statics problem, 
		if we are <strong>adding</strong> together the moments from multiple 
		forces, all the moments must be taken about a <strong>common axis of 
		rotation</strong>. Moments taken about different points cannot be added 
		together to find a 'net moment'</p>
		
		<p>Additionally, if we move into the subject of dynamics, where bodies 
		are moving, we will want to relate moments to angular accelerations. For 
		this to work, we will need to take the moments either about a single 
		point that does not move (such as the hinge on a door) or we will need 
		to take the moments about the center of mass of the body. Summing 
		moments about other axes of rotation will not result in valid 
		calculations.</p>
		
		<h2>Calculating Moments:</h2>
		
		<p>To calculate the moment that a force exerts on a body, we will have 
		two main options: <strong>scalar methods</strong> and <strong>vector 
		methods</strong>. Scalar methods are generally faster for two 
		dimensional problems where a body can only rotate clockwise or 
		counter-clockwise, while vector methods are generally faster for three 
		dimensional problems where the axis of rotation is more complex.</p>
