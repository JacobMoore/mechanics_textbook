		<h1>Newton's Second Law</h1>
				
		<h2>Translational Motion:</h2>
		
		<p>Newton's second law states that: <strong>"When a net force acts on 
		any body with mass, it produces an acceleration of that body. The net 
		force will be equal to the mass of the body times the acceleration of 
		the body"</strong></p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration in the equation 
		above are written in bold. This means that they are vector quantities, 
		having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a 
		scalar quantity having only a magnitude. Based on the above equation, 
		you can infer that the magnitude of the net force acting on the body 
		will be equal to the mass of the body times the magnitude of the 
		acceleration, and that the direction of the net force on the body will 
		be equal to the direction of the acceleration of the body.</p>
						
		<h3>Rotational Motion:</h3>
		
		<p>Newton's second law also applies to moments and rotational 
		velocities. The revised version of the second law equation states that 
		the net moment acting on the object will be equal to the second mass 
		moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation (I) times the 
		angular acceleration of the body.</p>

		<p>You should again notice that the moment and the angular acceleration 
		of the body are bold, indicating that they are vector quantities, having 
		both magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia on the other 
		hand is a scalar quantity having only a magnitude. The magnitude of the 
		net moment will be equal to the mass moment of inertia times the 
		magnitude of the angular acceleration, and the direction of the net 
		moment will be equal to the direction of the angular acceleration.</p>
