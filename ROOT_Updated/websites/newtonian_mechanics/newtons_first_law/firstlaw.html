		<h1>Newton's First Law</h1>
				
		<h2>Translational Motion:</h2>
		
		<p>Newton's first law states that: <strong>"A body at rest will remain at 
		rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. A body in motion 
		continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless 
		acted upon by an unbalanced force."</strong></p>
		
		<p>This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia", means that 
		bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to 
		change that velocity. If an object is at rest with zero velocity it will 
		remain at rest until some force begins to change that velocity, and if 
		an object is moving at a set speed and in a set direction it will remain 
		at that same velocity until some force begins to change that velocity.</p>

		<h3>Net Forces:</h3>
		
		<p>It is important to note that the <strong>net force</strong> is what 
		will cause a change in velocity. The net force is the sum of all forces 
		acting on the body. For example, we can imagine gently pushing on the 
		rock in the figure above and observing that the rock does not move. This 
		is because we will have a friction force equal in magnitude and opposite 
		in direction opposing our gentle pushing force. The sum of these two 
		forces will be equal to zero, therefore the net force is zero and the 
		change in velocity is zero.</p>
		
		<h3>Rotational Motion:</h3>

			<figcaption>In the absence of friction, this spinning top would 
			continue to spin forever, but the small frictional moment exerted at the 
			point of contact between the top and the ground will slow the tops 
			spinning over time </figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Newton's first law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. 
		A body will maintain it's current rotational velocity until a net moment 
		is exerted to change that rotational velocity. This can be seen in 
		things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects 
		that will continue spinning once started until brakes or friction stop 
		them.</p>
