		<h1>Newton's Third Law</h1>
		
		<p>Newton's Third Law states <strong>"For any action, there is an equal and 
		opposite reaction."</strong> By "action" Newton meant a force, so for every force 
		one body exerts on another body, that second body exerts a force of 
		equal magnitude but opposite direction back on the first body. Since all 
		forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all forces 
		come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting.</p>

			<figcaption>The gravitational pull of the earth and moon represent a 
			Newton's Third Law pair. The earth exerts a gravitational pull on 
			the moon, and the moon exerts an equal and opposite pull on the 
			earth.</figcaption>
		</figure>
						
		<p>Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single 
		body, it is important to remember that each of the forces a Third Law 
		pair acts on a separate body. This can sometimes be confusing when there 
		are multiple Third Law pairs at work. Below are some examples of 
		situations where multiple Third Law pairs occur.</p>

				<figcaption>This volleyball resting on a surface has two pairs 
				of Third Law forces. The first consists of the gravitational 
				forces (one force on the ball and one force on the ground). The second 
				consists of the normal forces at the point of contact (one force on 
				the ball and one force on the ground).</figcaption>

			<figcaption>If we ignore the weight of the two objects, this clamp 
			will also have two pairs of Third Law forces. The first will be a 
			set of normal forces at the top point of contact (one force on the

			of normal forces at the 
			bottom point of contact (one force on the wood and one force on the
