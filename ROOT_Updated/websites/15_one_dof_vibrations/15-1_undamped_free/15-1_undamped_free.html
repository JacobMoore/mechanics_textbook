    <h1>Undamped Free Vibrations</h1>
    <p>Vibrations occur in systems that attempt to return to their resting or equilibrium state when perturbed (or pushed away from their equilibrium state). The simplest vibrations to analyze are undamped, free, one degree of freedom vibrations. </p>
    <p>"Undamped" means that there are no energy losses with movement (whether intentional, by adding dampers, or unintentional, through drag or friction). An undamped system will vibrate forever without any additional applied forces. A simple pendulum is has very low damping, and will swing for a long time before stopping.  ("Damped" means that there are resistive forces and energy losses with movement that cause the system to stop moving eventually.)  </p>
    <p>"Free" means that, after the initial perturbation, the only forces acting on the system are internal to the system (springs, dampers) and/or gravity. A tuning fork continues to vibrate after one initial perturbation (being struck). ("Forced" means there is an external, typically periodic, force acting on the system. A jackhammer vibrates due to having a supply of compressed air continually forcing the bit up and down, and it stops vibrating very quickly without that external periodic forcing). </p>
    <p>"One degree of freedom" means that we will only consider systems with one mass vibrating along one direction (e.g. use variable x) or about one axis (e.g. use variable &#952). Systems having more than one mass or vibrating along or about two or more axes have more than one degree of freedom. </p>
	  
	<p>We can derive the equation of the system by setting up a free-body diagram.  Consider a mass sitting on a frictionless surface, attached to a wall via a spring.  </p>

    <figcaption>This is a system consisting of a mass attached to the wall via a spring, sitting on a frictionless surface. The system is currently in equilibrium, where the spring is not stretched or compressed.</figcaption>
    </figure>
	  
	<p>The system above is in equilibrium. It is at rest, and will stay at rest unless some other force acts on it. </p>

      <figcaption>Free-body diagram of the system in equilibrium posiiton. Since the spring is at its equilibrium position (neither stretched or unstretched), it does not produce a force. </figcaption>
    </figure>
	  
	<p>To start the system vibrating, we need to perturb it. Perturbation is moving the system away from equilibrium by a small amount. </p>
	  
	<figure class="center"> <img src="images/Slide3.png" width="482" height="250" alt="1DOF linear mass-spring system perturbed by x"/>
      <figcaption>Mass-spring system perturbed by an amount x from equilibrium. This stretches the spring, causing a spring force which tends to pull the mass back toward equilibrium. </figcaption>
    </figure>  
	
	  
	<p>When we perturb this system, we stretch the spring. This generates a spring force, and the spring force is always in a direction that tends to pull the system back toward equilibrium. </p>

      <figcaption>Mass-spring system vibration.  After an initial perturbation, the system oscillates between two extreme positions (-x_max and x_max). The extreme positions are turn-around points where the velocity is zero, but the spring force is maximum (maximum stretch/compression) and therefore the acceleration is maximum.  As the system passes through the equilibrium position, the spring is no longer stretched (zero force, zero acceleration), but the velocity is maximum (this can be determined using conservation of energy) and the inertia of the system carries the mass past the equilibrium position. In the absence of damping or the application of another force, the system will oscillate forever. </figcaption>
    </figure> 
	  
	  
	<p>We can generate the equation of motion of the system, and determine the specifics of how it will vibrate, by analyzing this perturbed state. Recall that the spring force or moment is: </p>
	<table class="equation">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\overset{\rightharpoonup}F{_k} =k \overset{\rightharpoonup}x \]</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\[\overset{\rightharpoonup} M{_k}=k \overset{\rightharpoonup}&#952 \]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
	
	<p>Note that the spring constants in the above equations have different units, depending on whether the spring is linear (N/m) or torsional (N-m/rad), and that &#952 must be given in radians. The magnitude of the spring force depends on <em>x</em>, the distance <strong>from the spring unstretched length</strong> (not necessarily the equilibrium position of the system), and the same is true for moment of a torsional spring. The spring force or moment is in the direction/orientation opposite that of the displacement.  That is, if you pull the mass to the right, the spring force points to the left. </p>
	<p>The process for finding the equation of motion of the system is as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Sketch the system with a small positive perturbation (<em>x</em> or <em>&#952</em>).</li>
		<li>Draw the free-body diagram of the perturbed system.  Ensure that the spring force has a direction opposing the perturbation. </li>
		<li>Find the one equation of motion for the system in the perturbed coordinate using Newton's Second Law. Keep the same positive direction for position, and assign positive acceleration in the same direction. </li>
		<li>Move all terms of the equation to one side, and check that all terms are positive.  If all terms are not positive, there is an error in the direction of displacement, acceleration, and/or spring force. </li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>For the example system above, with mass <em>m</em> and spring constant <em>k</em>, we derive the following:</p>
