		<h1>Belt Friction</h1>
				
		<p>In any system where a belt or a cable is wrapped around a pulley or 
		some other cylindrical surface, we have the potential for friction 
		between the belt or cable and the surface it is in contact with. In some 
		cases, such as a rope over a tree branch being used to lift an object, 
		the friction forces represent a loss. In other cases such as a belt 
		driven system, these friction forces are put to use transferring power 
		from one pulley to another pulley.</p>

		<p>For analysis, we will start a flat, massless belt passing over a 
		cylindrical surface. If we have an equal tension in each belt, the belt 
		will experience a non-uniform normal force from the cylinder that is 
		supporting it.</p>
		
		<p>In a frictionless scenario, if we were to increase the tension on one 
		side of the rope it would begin to slide across the cylinder. If 
		friction exists between the rope and the surface though, the friction 
		force will oppose with sliding motion, and prevent it up to a point.</p>

		<h3>Friction in Flat Belts</h3>
		
		<figure class="right">	
			<img alt="Pulleys" height="250" src="images/pulleys.png" width="250">
			<figcaption>For a flat belt, the belt or cable will interact with 
			the bottom surface. For a V belt, the belt or cable will interact 
			with the sides of a groove.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		
		<p>A flat belt is any system where the pulley or surface only interacts 
		with the bottom surface of the belt or cable. If the belt or cable 
		instead fits into a groove, then it is considered a V belt.</p>
		
		<p>When analyzing systems with belts, we are usually interested in the 
		range of values for the tension forces where the belt will not slip 
		relative to the surface. Starting with the smaller tension force on one 
		side (T1) we, can increase the second tension force (T2) to some maximum 
		value before slipping. For a flat belt, the maximum value for T2 will depend on the value 
		of T1, the static coefficient of friction between the belt and the 
		surface, and the contact angle between the belt and the surface (Beta) 
		given in radians, as described in the equation below.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Belt Friction Equation" height="374" src="images/belteqn.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>The maximum value of T2 before the belt starts slipping 
			can be determined with the equation above.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h3>Friction in V Belts</h3>
		
		<p>A V belt is any belt that fits into a groove on a pulley or surface. 
		For the V belt to be effective, the belt or cable will need to be in 
		contact with the sides of the groove, but not the base of the groove as 
		shown in the diagram below. With the normal forces on each side, the 
		vertical components must add up the the same as what the flat belt would 
		have, but the added horizontal components of the normal forces, which 
		cancel each other out, increase the potential for friction forces.</p>
		
		<p>The equation for the maximum difference in tensions in V belt systems 
		is similar to the equation in flat belt systems, except we use an 
		"enhanced" coefficient of friction that takes into account the increased 
		normal and friction forces possible because of the groove.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Friction for V Belts" height="284" src="images/vbelteqn.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>In a V belt, the "enhanced" coefficient of friction 
			takes into account the coefficient of friction&nbsp; between the two 
			materials as well as the groove angle.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>As we can see from the equation above, steeper sides to the groove 
		(which would result in a smaller angle alpha) result in an increased 
		potential difference in the tension forces. The trade-off with steeper 
		sides however is that the belt becomes wedged in the groove and will 
		require force to unwedge itself from the groove as it leaves the pulley. 
		This will cause losses that decrease the efficiency of the belt driven 
		system. If very high tension differences are required, chain driven 
		systems offer an alternative that is usually more efficient.</p>

		
		<h3>Torque and Power Transmission in Belt Driven Systems</h3>
		
		<p>In belt driven systems there is usually an input pulley and one or 
		more output pulleys. To determine the maximum torque or power that can 
		be transmitted by the belt, we will need to consider each of the pulleys 
		independently, understanding that slipping occurring at either the input 
		or the output will result in a failure of the power transmission.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">	
			<img alt="Belt Drive System" height="289" src="images/beltdrive.png" width="600">
			<figcaption>A belt driven system with a single input and a single 
			output.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The first step in determining the maximum torque or power that can be 
		transmitted in the belt drive is to determine the maximum possible value 
		for T2 before slipping occurs at either the input or output pulley 
		(again slipping at either location cannot occur). To start we will often 
		be given the "resting tension". This is the tension in the belt when 
		everything is stationary and before power is transferred. Sometimes 
		machines will have adjustments to increase or decrease the resting 
		tension by slighting increasing or decreasing the distance between the 
		pulleys. If we turn on the machine and increase the load torque at the 
		output, the tension on the one side of the pulleys will remain constant 
		as the resting tension while the tension on the other side will 
		increase. Since the resting tension is constant and always the lower of 
		the two tensions, it will be the T1 tension the equations discussed in 
		earlier sections.</p>
		
		<p>Though it is often wise to check, assuming the pulleys are the same 
		material (and therefore the same coefficients of friction), it is often 
		assumed that the belt will first slip at the smaller of the two pulleys 
		in a single input, single output belt system. This is because the 
		smaller pulley will have a the smaller contact angle (Beta), while all 
		other values remain the same.</p>
		
		<p>Once we have the maximum value for T2, we can use that to find the 
		torque at the input pulley and the torque at the output pulley. Note 
		that these two values will not be the same unless the pulleys are the 
		same size. To find the toque, we will simply need to find the net moment 
		exerted by the two tension forces, where the radius of the pulley is the 
		moment arm.</p>

		<figure class="equation">	
			<img alt="Maximum torque before slipping" src="images/toqueeqn.png">					
		</figure>
		
		<p>To find the maximum power we can transfer with the belt drive system, 
		we will use the rotational definition of power, where the power is equal 
		to the toque times the angular velocity in radians per second. Unlike 
		the torque, the power at the input and the output will be the same 
		assuming no inefficiencies.</p>
