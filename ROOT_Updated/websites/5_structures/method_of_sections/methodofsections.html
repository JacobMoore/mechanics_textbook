		<h1>The Method of Sections</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>method of sections</strong> is a process used to solve for 
		the unknown forces acting on members of a <strong>truss</strong>. The 
		method involves breaking the truss down into individual sections and 
		analyzing each section as a separate rigid body. The method of sections 
		is usually the fastest and easiest way to determine the unknown forces 
		acting in a specific member of the truss.</p>
		
		<h2>Using the Method of Sections:</h2>
		
		<p>The process used in the method of sections is outlined below:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>In the beginning it is usually useful to label the members in your truss. This will help you keep everything organized 
			and consistent in later analysis. In this book, the members will be 
			labeled with letters.</li>
			
			<figure class="center">
				<img alt="Method of Sections Labels" height="203" src="images/MOSlabels.png" width="400">
				<figcaption>The first step in the method of sections is to label each member.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Treating the entire truss structure as a rigid body, draw a free 
			body diagram, write out the equilibrium equations, and solve for the 
			external reacting forces acting on the truss structure. This analysis 
			should not differ from the analysis of a single rigid body.</li>
			
			<figure class="center">

				<figcaption>Treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for 
				the reaction forces supporting the truss structure.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Next you will imagine cutting your truss into two separate 
			sections. The cut should travel through the member that you are 
			trying to solve for the forces in, and should cut through as few 
			members as possible (The cut does not need to be a straight line).</li>
			
			<figure class="center">
				<img alt="Method of Sections Cutting the Truss" height="220" src="images/MOScut.png" width="400">
				<figcaption>Next you will imagine cutting the truss into two 
				parts. If you want to find the forces in a specific member be 
				sure to cut through that member. It also makes things easier if 
				you cut through as few members as possible.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Next you will draw a free body diagram for either one, or both 
			sections that you created. Be sure to include all the forces acting 
			on each section.  				
					<ul>
					<li>Any external reaction or load forces that may be acting 
					at the section.</li>
					<li>An internal force in each member that was cut when 
					splitting the truss into sections. Remember that for a two force member, the force 
					will be acting along the line between the two connection 
					points on the member. We will also need to guess if it will 
					be a tensile or a compressive force. An incorrect guess now 
					though will simply lead to a negative solution later on. A 
					common strategy then is to assume all forces are tensile, 
					then later in the solution any positive forces will be 
					tensile forces and any negative forces will be compressive 
					forces. </li>
					<li>Label each force in the diagram. Include any known 
					magnitudes and directions and provide variable names for 
					each unknown.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<figure class="center">		
				<img alt="Method of Sections" height="270" src="images/MOSsection.png" width="400">
				<figcaption>Next draw a free body diagram of one or both halves 
				of the truss. Add the known forces, as well as unknown tensile 
				forces for each member that you cut.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Write out the equilibrium equations for each section you drew a 
			free body diagram of. These will be extended bodies, so you will 
			need to write out the force and the moment equations. </li>
	
			<figure class="center">		
				<img alt="Equilibrium Equations 2D" src="images/2Dequations.png"><br>
				<figcaption>For 2D problems you will have three possible 
				equations for each section, two force equations and one moment 
				equation.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<figure class="center">		
				<img alt="Equilibrium Equations 3D" src="images/3Dequations.png">
				<figcaption>For 3D problems you will have six possible equations 
				for each section, three force equations and three moment 
				equations.</figcaption>
			</figure>


			<li>Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You 
			can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or 
			you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. If you 
			assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, remember that negative 
			answers indicate compressive forces in the members.</li>
