    <h1>The Method of Sections</h1>
    <p>The <strong>method of sections</strong> is a process used to solve for 
      the unknown forces acting on members of a <strong>truss</strong>. The 
      method involves breaking the truss down into individual sections and 
      analyzing each section as a separate rigid body. The method of sections 
      is usually the fastest and easiest way to determine the unknown forces 
      acting in a specific member of the truss.</p>
    <h2>Using the Method of Sections:</h2>
    <p>The process used in the method of sections is outlined below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the beginning it is usually useful to label the members in your truss. This will help you keep everything organized 
        and consistent in later analysis. In this book, the members will be 
        labeled with letters.</li>
      <figure class="center"> <img alt="Method of Sections Labels" height="203" src="images/MOSlabels.png" width="400">
        <figcaption>The first step in the method of sections is to label each member.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>Treating the entire truss structure as a rigid body, draw a free 
        body diagram, write out the equilibrium equations, and solve for the 
        external reacting forces acting on the truss structure. This analysis 
        should not differ from the analysis of a single rigid body.</li>
      <figure class="center"> <img alt="Method of Sections Reactions" height="211" src="images/MOSfbd.png" width="400">
        <figcaption>Treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for 
          the reaction forces supporting the truss structure.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>Next you will imagine cutting your truss into two separate 
        sections. The cut should travel through the member that you are 
        trying to solve for the forces in, and should cut through as few 
        members as possible (The cut does not need to be a straight line).</li>
      <figure class="center"> <img alt="Method of Sections Cutting the Truss" height="220" src="images/MOScut.png" width="400">
        <figcaption>Next you will imagine cutting the truss into two 
          parts. If you want to find the forces in a specific member be 
          sure to cut through that member. It also makes things easier if 
          you cut through as few members as possible.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>Next you will draw a free body diagram for either one, or both 
        sections that you created. Be sure to include all the forces acting 
        on each section.
        <ul>
          <li>Any external reaction or load forces that may be acting 
            at the section.</li>
          <li>An internal force in each member that was cut when 
            splitting the truss into sections. Remember that for a two force member, the force 
            will be acting along the line between the two connection 
            points on the member. We will also need to guess if it will 
            be a tensile or a compressive force. An incorrect guess now 
            though will simply lead to a negative solution later on. A 
            common strategy then is to assume all forces are tensile, 
            then later in the solution any positive forces will be 
            tensile forces and any negative forces will be compressive 
            forces. </li>
          <li>Label each force in the diagram. Include any known 
            magnitudes and directions and provide variable names for 
            each unknown.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <figure class="center"> <img alt="Method of Sections" height="270" src="images/MOSsection.png" width="400">
        <figcaption>Next draw a free body diagram of one or both halves 
          of the truss. Add the known forces, as well as unknown tensile 
          forces for each member that you cut.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>Write out the equilibrium equations for each section you drew a 
        free body diagram of. These will be extended bodies, so you will 
        need to write out the force and the moment equations. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>For 2D problems you will have three possible equations for each section, two force equations and one moment equation.</li>
        <table class="equation">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td colspan="2">\[\sum \vec{F}=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum \vec{M}=0\]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>\[\sum F_x=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum F_y=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum M_z=0\]</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <li>For 3D problems you will have six possible equations for each section, three force equations and three moment equations.</li>
        <table class="equation">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td colspan="3">\[\sum \vec{F}=0\]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>\[\sum F_x=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum F_y=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum F_z=0\]</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <table class="equation">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td colspan="3">\[\sum \vec{M}=0\]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>\[\sum M_x=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum M_y=0\]</td>
              <td>\[\sum M_z=0\]</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </ul>
      <li>Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You 
        can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or 
        you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. If you 
        assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, remember that negative 
        answers indicate compressive forces in the members.</li>
