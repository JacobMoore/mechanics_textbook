		<h1>Engineering Structures</h1>
				
		<p>An <strong>engineering structure</strong> is term used to describe 
		any <strong>set of 
		interconnected bodies</strong>. The different bodies in the structure 
		can move relative to one another (such as the blades in a pair of 
		scissors) or they can be be fixed relative to one another (such as the 
		different beams connected to form a bridge). </p>
		
		<figure class="center">

			<figcaption>This pair of scissors is an example of an engineering 
			structure. The structure consists of three different bodies that are 
			interconnected.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>When analyzing engineering structures, we will sometimes analyze the 
		structure as a whole, and we will sometimes break the structure down 
		into individual bodies that are analyzed separately.&nbsp; The exact 
		methods used depend upon what unknown forces we are looking for and what 
		type of structure we are analyzing.</p>
		
		<h2>Internal and External Forces:</h2>
		
		<p>When examining a single body, we would find the forces that this body 
		exerted on surrounding bodies, and the forces that these surrounding 
		bodies would exert on the body we are analyzing. These forces are all 
		considered <strong>external forces</strong> because they are forces between the body and 
		the external environment.</p>
		
		<p>In an engineering structure, we still have external forces where the 
		structure is interacting with bodies external to the structure, but we 
		also can think about the forces that different parts of the structure 
		exert on one another (the force between the pin and the blade in the 
		diagram above for example). Since both of these bodies are part of the 
		structure we are analyzing, this forces are considered <strong>internal 
		forces</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>If we only wish to determine the external forces acting on a 
		structure, then we can treat the whole structure as a single body 
		(assuming the structure is rigid as a whole). If we wish to determine 
		the internal forces acting between components in the structure, then we 
		will need to disassemble the structure into separate bodies in our 
		analysis.</p>
		
		<h2>Types of Structures:</h2>
		
		<p>Another important consideration when analyzing structures is the type 
		of structure that is being analyzed. All structures fall into one of 
		three categories: <strong>trusses</strong>, <strong>frames</strong>, or 
		<strong>machines</strong>. Frames and machines are analyzed in the same 
		way so distinction between them is less important, but the analysis 
		methods used for trusses vary greatly from the analysis methods used for 
		frames and machines, so determining if a structure is a truss or not is 
		an important first step in structure analysis.</p>
		
		<h3>Trusses:</h3>
		
		<p>A <strong>truss</strong> is a structure that consists <strong>entirely</strong> of 
		t<strong>wo force members</strong>. If any one body in the structure is 
		not a two force member then the structure is either a frame or a 
		machine. Also in order to be a <strong>statically determinate</strong> 
		truss (a truss where we can actually solve for all the unknowns) the 
		truss must be independently rigid as a whole. If different parts of the 
		truss could 
		move relative to one another then the truss separated is not independently rigid.</p>
		
		<figure class="center">
			<img alt="Truss Bridge by Leonard G. (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons" height="200" src="images/bridge.jpg" width="400">
			<figcaption>This bridge is an example of a truss. It consists of a 
			number of members connected at only two points (the ends of the 
			beams).</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>A two force member is a body where forces are applied at only two 
		locations. If forces are applied at more than two locations, or if any 
		moments are applied then the body is not a two force member (see the two 
		force member page for more details). Because of the unique assumptions 
		we can make with two force members, we can apply two unique methods to 
		the analysis of trusses (the method of joints and the method of 
		sections) that we cannot apply to frames and machines (where we cannot 
		assume we have two force members). </p>
		
		<h3>Frames and Machines:</h3>
		
		<p>A frame or a machine is structure where at least one component of the 
		structure is not a two force member. This will be a body in the 
		structure that has forces acting at three or more points on the body. 
		The difference between a frame and a machine is that a frame is rigid as 
		a whole while a machine is not rigid as a whole.</p>

				can also move relative to one another so this is an example of a 
				machine.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>Because frames and machines do not consist entirely of two force 
		members, we cannot make the assumptions that allow us to use the method 
		of joints and the method of sections. For this reason, we need to use a 
		different analysis method (simply called the analysis of frames and 
		machines here). </p>
