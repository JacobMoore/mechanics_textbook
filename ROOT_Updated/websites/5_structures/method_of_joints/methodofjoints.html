		<h1>The Method of Joints</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>method of joints</strong> is a process used to solve for 
		the unknown forces acting on members of a <strong>truss</strong>. The 
		method centers on the joints or connection points between the members, 
		and it is usually the fastest and easiest way to solve for all the 
		unknown forces in a truss structure.</p>
		
		<h2>Using the Method of Joints:</h2>
		
		<p>The process used in the method of joints is outlined below:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>In the  beginning it is usually useful to label the members and the 
			joints in your truss. This will help you keep everything organized 
			and consistent in later analysis. In this book, the members will be 
			labeled with letters and the joints will be labeled with numbers.</li>
			
			<figure class="center">

				<figcaption>The first step in the method of joints is to label 
				each joint and each member.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Treating the entire truss structure as a rigid body, draw a free 
			body diagram, write out the equilibrium equations, and solve for the 
			external reacting forces acting on the truss structure. This analysis 
			should not differ from the analysis of a single rigid body.</li>

				<figcaption>Treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for 
				the reaction forces supporting the truss structure.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Assume there is a pin or some other small amount of material at 
			each of the connection points between the members. Next you will 
			draw a free body diagram for each connection point. Remember to 
			include: 				
					<ul>
					<li>Any external reaction or load forces that may be acting 
					at that joint.</li>
					<li>A normal force for each two force member connected to 
					that joint. Remember that for a two force member, the force 
					will be acting along the line between the two connection 
					points on the member. We will also need to guess if it will 
					be a tensile or a compressive force. An incorrect guess now 
					though will simply lead to a negative solution later on. A 
					common strategy then is to assume all forces are tensile, 
					then later in the solution any positive forces will be 
					tensile forces and any negative forces will be compressive 
					forces. </li>
					<li>Label each force in the diagram. Include any known 
					magnitudes and directions and provide variable names for 
					each unknown.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

				<figcaption>Drawing a free body diagram of each joint, we draw 
				in the known forces as well as tensile forces from each two 
				force member.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<li>Write out the equilibrium equations for <strong>each of the joints</strong>. You 
			should treat the joints as particles, so there will be force 
			equations but no moment equations. With either two (for 2D problems) 
			or three (for 3D problems) equations for each joint, this should 
			give you a large number of equations.</li>
	
			<table class="figtable"><tr>
		<td>
			<figure>
				<img alt="2D Equilibrium Equations" height="135" src="images/2Dequations.png" width="200">
				<figcaption>In planar trusses, the sum of the forces in the x 
				direction will be zero and the sum of the forces in the y 
				direction will be zero for each of the joints.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</td>	
		<td>
			<figure>
				<img alt="3D Equilibrium Equations" height="152" src="images/3Dequations.png" width="300">
				<figcaption>In space trusses, the sum of the forces in the x 
				direction will be zero, the sum of the forces in the y direction 
				will be zero, and the sum of forces in the z direction will be 
				zero for each of the joints.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

			<li>Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You 
			can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or 
			you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. If you 
			assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, remember that negative 
			answers indicate compressive forces in the members.</li>
