<h2>About the Adaptive Map Tool:</h2>

<p>The Adaptive Map Digital Textbook Project is a open digital textbook founded 
on the idea that expert generated concept maps can serve as a powerful advance 
organizer for textbook content. The overview at the beginning of each chapter 
consists of a video showing how all the topics in the chapter are linked 
together by the author. By providing this overview, the author is seeking to 
help users organize the knowledge they are developing in a way that matches the 
expert's organization of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Theoretical Basis:</h3>

<p>Advance organizers are high level overviews of more detailed information 
presented to a learner before detailed instruction in language a novice can 
understand. This overview will ideally link the new ideas to the learner's prior 
knowledge. When used with instruction, advance organizers have been shown to 
have a small but significant positive impact on the understanding and retention 
of the content.</p>

<p>Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show the major concepts in a content 
area and how those concepts are linked. Concept maps were originally developed 
as a way to chart what children did and did not understand, but they were 
quickly found to be effective as a learning aid. Expert-generated concept maps 
can serve as particularly powerful advance 
	organizers because of their explicit highlighting of the relationships 
between concepts.</p>

<h3>Project History:</h3>

<p>Work on the Adaptive Map project began in 2011 with NSF funding to explore 
the feasibility and usefulness of a content navigation system based on expert 
generated concept maps. This interactive navigation system replaced a 
traditional table of contents, and allowed users to navigate the material in a 
non-linear way, all the while absorbing the expert generated concept map as an 
advance organizer.</p>

<p>Videos of the original navigation system can be seen below.</p>

<p>The tool was tested in the classroom and was shown to be more effective 
than a traditional paper textbook in two respects. First, as predicted with the 
design, the tool encourages users to spend more time attending to an overview of 
the information, helping students build a skeleton they can fit details into 
later. Second, the tool encouraged users to step back and review topics from 
previous sections that were relevant to the topics they were learning. This 
combination of behaviors in the users leads to greater measures of conceptual 
understanding, with little to no extra effort on the part of the learner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the original navigation system, built as a Java Applet, is now 
inoperable in all major browsers due to the security concerns with Applets. 
Despite this setback with the software, the content has been significantly 
expanded to all of engineering statics with video lectures, worked examples, and 
homework problems. Additionally, the video introduction at the beginning of each 
chapter highlights an expert generated concept map to use as an advance 
organizer for that chapter's concepts.</p>
