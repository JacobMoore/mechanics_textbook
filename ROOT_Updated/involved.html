    <h2>Get Involved in the Mechanics Map Project</h2>
    <p>The Mechanics Map Open Textbook Project is an ongoing effort of lead author Jacob Moore, but many others have contributed to the project along the way, and I am always looking for others who want to help. If you are interested in contributing to the project, the first step would be to send me an email at <a href="mailto:jmoore@psu.edu">jmoore@psu.edu</a>.</p>
    <p>Both technical and non-technical help is appreciated, including efforts to...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop new content pages,</li>
      <li>Develop new worked example and homework problems,</li>
      <li>Record video lectures and worked problem videos,</li>
      <li>Develop interactive elements,</li>
      <li>and finally proofread existing content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything from wanting to become an ongoing contributor to reporting a single error is welcome.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the complete website for the Mechanics Map project is open source and available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/JacobMoore/mechanics_textbook">https://github.com/JacobMoore/mechanics_textbook</a>.
