<p>Hello, my name is Jacob Moore and I am an Associate Professor of Engineering at Penn State Mont Alto.  This web page serves as an overview of my experiences and interests as a teacher, researcher, and a member of the Penn State community.</p>

<p>As a teacher I cover a variety of engineering and math subjects including design, statics, dynamics, strength of materials, thermodynamics, trigonometry, and matrices.  I also run the engineering lab located on the Penn State Mont Alto Campus, giving students access to the tools they need to design, prototype, and test their designs as practicing engineers would.  For more details on my teaching interests and experiences please visit my teaching page.</p>

<p>As a researcher, my interests include engineering education (focusing on open educational resources) and additive manufacturing (focusing on low-cost additive manufacturing technologies).  For more details on my research interests and current projects please visit my research page.</p>

<p>You can also view a PDF version of my <a href="CurriculumVitae.pdf">curriculum vitae</a> here.</p>
